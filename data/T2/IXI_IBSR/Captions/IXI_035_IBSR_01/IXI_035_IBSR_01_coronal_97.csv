description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, revealing the head of a man of 37 years old, with coronal section n°97 initiated from the back of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1363.1836 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2717.1387 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1417.2363 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2895.1172 mm³ there."
"Image in weighting T2 of the MRI size (256, 256, 1), showing the head of a man of 37 years old of coronal section. Slice n°97 is observed from the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1363.1836 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2717.1387 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1417.2363 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2895.1172 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) of a human head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with coronal section. We carefully examine slice n°97 from the back of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1363.1836 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2717.1387 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1417.2363 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2895.1172 mm³."
"MRI size (256, 256, 1) in weighting T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section. The observation is made on slice n°97 from the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1363.1836 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2717.1387 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1417.2363 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2895.1172 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (256, 256, 1) with weighting in T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old, in slice coronal n°97 starting from the back of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1363.1836 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2717.1387 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1417.2363 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2895.1172 mm³."
