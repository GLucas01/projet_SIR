description
"Image size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2 of the MRI, showing the head of a man of 37 years old of axial section. Slice n°180 is observed starting from the base of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1083.6914 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3307.7637 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1107.4219 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3265.5762 mm³."
