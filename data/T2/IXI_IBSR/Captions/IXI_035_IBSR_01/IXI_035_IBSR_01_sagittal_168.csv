description
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256, 1) in T2, exhibiting the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°168 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3707.2266 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6483.6914 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 73.8281 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1340.7715 mm³."
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) size (128, 256, 1) capture representing the head of a man aged  of 37 years old, with a sequence weighted in T2 and sagittal section, starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3707.2266 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6483.6914 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 73.8281 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1340.7715 mm³."
"Image size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2 of the MRI, showing the head of a man of 37 years old of sagittal section. Slice n°168 is observed starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We observe the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3707.2266 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6483.6914 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 73.8281 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1340.7715 mm³ there."
