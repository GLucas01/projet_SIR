description
"MRI size (256, 256, 1) in weighting T2, showing the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°6 initiated from the back of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 350.6836 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1821.9727 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 296.6309 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1607.0801 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with coronal section. We observe slice n°6 starting at the back of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 350.6836 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1821.9727 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 296.6309 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1607.0801 mm³ there."

"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of coronal section. We observe slice n°6 beginning from the back of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 350.6836 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1821.9727 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 296.6309 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1607.0801 mm³ in it."
"MRI size (256, 256, 1) in weighting T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old of coronal section. The observation focuses on slice n°6 from the back of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 350.6836 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1821.9727 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 296.6309 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1607.0801 mm³."
