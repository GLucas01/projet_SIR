description
"Magnetic resonance image (MRI) size (128, 256, 1) capturing the head of a man aged  of 37 years old, with a sequence weighted in T2 and sagittal section. The specific slice is number 91, counted from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4605.0293 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5816.6016 mm³, the temporal horn of left lateral ventricle of volume 22.4121 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 138.4277 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1400.0977 mm³ and the left hippocampus of volume 104.1504 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2 of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section n°91 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4605.0293 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5816.6016 mm³, the temporal horn of left lateral ventricle of volume 22.4121 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 138.4277 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1400.0977 mm³ and the left hippocampus of volume 104.1504 mm³."
"MRI size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2, showing the head of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section n°91 initiated from the right hemisphere of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4605.0293 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5816.6016 mm³, the temporal horn of left lateral ventricle of volume 22.4121 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 138.4277 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1400.0977 mm³ and the left hippocampus of volume 104.1504 mm³."
