description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, revealing the head of a man of 37 years old, with coronal section n°10 initiated from the back of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 862.2070 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2340.0879 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 704.0039 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2115.9668 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 188.5254 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (256, 256, 1) with weighting in T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old, in slice coronal n°10 starting from the back of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 862.2070 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2340.0879 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 704.0039 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2115.9668 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 188.5254 mm³."

"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with coronal section. We carefully observe slice n°10 beginning from the back of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 862.2070 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2340.0879 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 704.0039 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2115.9668 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 188.5254 mm³."
