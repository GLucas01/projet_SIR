description
"MRI snapshot size (256, 256, 1) with weighting in T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old, in slice coronal n°88 starting from the back of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2137.0605 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3166.6992 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 52.7344 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2222.7539 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3343.3594 mm³ and the right lateral ventricle of volume 61.9629 mm³."
