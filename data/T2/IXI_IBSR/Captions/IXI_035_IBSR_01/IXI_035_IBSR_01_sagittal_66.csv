description
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) size (128, 256, 1) capture representing the head of a man aged  of 37 years old, with a sequence weighted in T2 and sagittal section, starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 300.5859 mm³ and the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4092.1875 mm³."
"Magnetic resonance image (MRI) size (128, 256, 1) capturing the head of a man aged  of 37 years old, with a sequence weighted in T2 and sagittal section. The specific slice is number 66, counted from the right hemisphere of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 300.5859 mm³ and the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4092.1875 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256, 1) in T2 showing the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°66 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 300.5859 mm³ and the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4092.1875 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256, 1) weighted in T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section n°66 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 300.5859 mm³ and the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4092.1875 mm³ there."
