description
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with coronal section. We observe slice n°28 starting at the back of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1721.7773 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4050.0000 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 29.0039 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 333.5449 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 2632.7637 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1597.8516 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3860.1562 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 359.9121 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 2551.0254 mm³."

"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°28 starting from the back of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1721.7773 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4050.0000 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 29.0039 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 333.5449 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 2632.7637 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1597.8516 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3860.1562 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 359.9121 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 2551.0254 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with coronal section. We carefully observe slice n°28 beginning from the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1721.7773 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4050.0000 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 29.0039 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 333.5449 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 2632.7637 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1597.8516 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3860.1562 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 359.9121 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 2551.0254 mm³."
