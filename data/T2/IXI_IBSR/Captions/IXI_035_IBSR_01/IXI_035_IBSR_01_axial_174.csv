description
"MRI snapshot size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2 describing the skull of a man of age  of 37 years old, of axial section n°174 from the base of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1605.7617 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3841.6992 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1543.7988 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4030.2246 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 128, 1) in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°174 starting from the base of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1605.7617 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3841.6992 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1543.7988 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4030.2246 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, of axial section. We observe slice n°174 beginning from the base of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1605.7617 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3841.6992 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1543.7988 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4030.2246 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2 describing the skull of a man of age  of 37 years old, of axial section n°174 from the base of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1605.7617 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3841.6992 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1543.7988 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4030.2246 mm³ in it."
"Illustration size (256, 128, 1) by MRI of the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°174 starting from the base of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1605.7617 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3841.6992 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1543.7988 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4030.2246 mm³."
