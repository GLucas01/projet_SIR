description
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) of a human head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with coronal section. We carefully examine slice n°17 from the back of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1294.6289 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2854.2480 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 10.5469 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 27.6855 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1323.6328 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1306.4941 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2674.9512 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 76.4648 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1402.7344 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 256, 1) in T2, exposing the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°17 starting from the back of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1294.6289 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2854.2480 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 10.5469 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 27.6855 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1323.6328 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1306.4941 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2674.9512 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 76.4648 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1402.7344 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 256, 1) in T2, exhibiting the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°17 starting from the back of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1294.6289 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2854.2480 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 10.5469 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 27.6855 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1323.6328 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1306.4941 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2674.9512 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 76.4648 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1402.7344 mm³."

"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, revealing the head of a man of 37 years old, with coronal section n°17 initiated from the back of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1294.6289 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2854.2480 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 10.5469 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 27.6855 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1323.6328 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1306.4941 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2674.9512 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 76.4648 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1402.7344 mm³."
