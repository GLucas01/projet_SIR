description
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with sagittal section. We observe slice n°76 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1873.3887 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5985.3516 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 655.2246 mm³ in it."
