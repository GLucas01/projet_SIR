description
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256, 1) in T2, exhibiting the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°179 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1886.5723 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5769.1406 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 644.6777 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) weighted in T2, revealing the head of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section n°179 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1886.5723 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5769.1406 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 644.6777 mm³."
"MRI size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section. The observation is made on slice n°179 from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1886.5723 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5769.1406 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 644.6777 mm³."
"MRI size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2, showing the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°179 initiated from the right hemisphere of the skull. We observe the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1886.5723 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5769.1406 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 644.6777 mm³ there."
"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in T2, representing the head of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section n°179 beginning from the right hemisphere of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1886.5723 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5769.1406 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 644.6777 mm³."
