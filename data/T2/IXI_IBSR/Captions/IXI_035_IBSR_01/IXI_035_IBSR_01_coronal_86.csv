description
"MRI size (256, 256, 1) in weighting T2, showing the head of a man of 37 years old, with coronal section n°86 starting from the back of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2047.4121 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3535.8398 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 129.1992 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2159.4727 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3581.9824 mm³ and the right lateral ventricle of volume 127.8809 mm³ there."
"Image in weighting T2 of the MRI size (256, 256, 1), showing the head of a man of 37 years old of coronal section. Slice n°86 is observed from the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2047.4121 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3535.8398 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 129.1992 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2159.4727 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3581.9824 mm³ and the right lateral ventricle of volume 127.8809 mm³."
"Weighted MRI image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, representing the head of a man of 37 years old, with coronal section n°86 starting at the back of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2047.4121 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3535.8398 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 129.1992 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2159.4727 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3581.9824 mm³ and the right lateral ventricle of volume 127.8809 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, revealing the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°86 beginning from the back of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2047.4121 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3535.8398 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 129.1992 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2159.4727 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3581.9824 mm³ and the right lateral ventricle of volume 127.8809 mm³."
