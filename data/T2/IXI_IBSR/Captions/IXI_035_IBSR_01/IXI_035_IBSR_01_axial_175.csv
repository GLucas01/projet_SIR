description
"Image size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2 of the MRI, showing the head of a man of 37 years old of axial section. Slice n°175 is observed starting from the base of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1497.6562 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3792.9199 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1429.1016 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3935.3027 mm³ there."
