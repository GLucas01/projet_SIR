description
"Image size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2 of the MRI, showing the head of a man of 37 years old of axial section. Slice n°168 is observed starting from the base of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2129.1504 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4251.7090 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2263.6230 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4102.7344 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 128, 1) in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°168 starting from the base of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2129.1504 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4251.7090 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2263.6230 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4102.7344 mm³."
