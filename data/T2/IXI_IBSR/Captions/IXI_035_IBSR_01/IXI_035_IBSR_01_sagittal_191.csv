description
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with sagittal section. We observe slice n°191 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 100.1953 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3361.8164 mm³."
