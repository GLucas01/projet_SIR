description
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) of a human head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of coronal section. We observe slice n°18 starting from the back of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1371.0938 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2982.1289 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 14.5020 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 46.1426 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1468.6523 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1306.4941 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2979.4922 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 105.4688 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1525.3418 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with coronal section. We carefully observe slice n°18 beginning from the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1371.0938 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2982.1289 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 14.5020 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 46.1426 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1468.6523 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1306.4941 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2979.4922 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 105.4688 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1525.3418 mm³."
