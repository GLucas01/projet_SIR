description
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256, 1) in T2, exhibiting the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°78 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2291.3086 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6096.0938 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 789.6973 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) of a human head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with sagittal section. We observe slice n°78 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2291.3086 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6096.0938 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 789.6973 mm³."
