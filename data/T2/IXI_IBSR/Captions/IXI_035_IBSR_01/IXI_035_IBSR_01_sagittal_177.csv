description
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of sagittal section. We observe slice n°177 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2254.3945 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5976.1230 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 816.0645 mm³."
"MRI size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section. The observation is made on slice n°177 from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2254.3945 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5976.1230 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 816.0645 mm³ in it."

"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in T2, depicting the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°177 beginning from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2254.3945 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5976.1230 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 816.0645 mm³."
