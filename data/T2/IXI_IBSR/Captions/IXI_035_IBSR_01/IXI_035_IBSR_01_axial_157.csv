description
"MRI size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, depicting the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°157 starting from the base of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3465.9668 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4304.4434 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3966.9434 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3936.6211 mm³."
"Image size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2 of the MRI, showing the head of a man of 37 years old of axial section. Slice n°157 is observed starting from the base of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3465.9668 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4304.4434 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3966.9434 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3936.6211 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2 describing the skull of a man of age  of 37 years old, of axial section n°157 from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3465.9668 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4304.4434 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3966.9434 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3936.6211 mm³."
