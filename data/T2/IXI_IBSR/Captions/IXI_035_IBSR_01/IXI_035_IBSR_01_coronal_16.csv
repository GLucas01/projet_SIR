"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of coronal section. We observe slice n°16 starting from the back of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1344.7266 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2589.2578 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 10.5469 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1173.3398 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1298.5840 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2548.3887 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 7.9102 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1293.3105 mm³ there."
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with coronal section. We carefully observe slice n°16 beginning from the back of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1344.7266 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2589.2578 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 10.5469 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1173.3398 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1298.5840 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2548.3887 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 7.9102 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1293.3105 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) of a human head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with coronal section. We carefully examine slice n°16 from the back of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1344.7266 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2589.2578 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 10.5469 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1173.3398 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1298.5840 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2548.3887 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 7.9102 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1293.3105 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) of a human head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of coronal section. We observe slice n°16 starting from the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1344.7266 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2589.2578 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 10.5469 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1173.3398 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1298.5840 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2548.3887 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 7.9102 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1293.3105 mm³."
