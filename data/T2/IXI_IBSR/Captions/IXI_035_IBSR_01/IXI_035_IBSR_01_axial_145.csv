description
"MRI size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old of axial section. The observation focuses on slice n°145 starting from the base of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3368.4082 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4382.2266 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 495.7031 mm³, the left thalamus of volume 170.0684 mm³, the left caudate nucleus of volume 119.9707 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3580.6641 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4101.4160 mm³, the right lateral ventricle of volume 460.1074 mm³, the right thalamus proper of volume 159.5215 mm³ and the right caudate nucleus of volume 137.1094 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) with weighted imaging in T2, depicting the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°145 beginning from the base of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3368.4082 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4382.2266 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 495.7031 mm³, the left thalamus of volume 170.0684 mm³, the left caudate nucleus of volume 119.9707 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3580.6641 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4101.4160 mm³, the right lateral ventricle of volume 460.1074 mm³, the right thalamus proper of volume 159.5215 mm³ and the right caudate nucleus of volume 137.1094 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with axial section. We observe slice n°145 beginning from the base of the skull.

"Illustration size (256, 128, 1) by MRI of the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°145 starting from the base of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3368.4082 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4382.2266 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 495.7031 mm³, the left thalamus of volume 170.0684 mm³, the left caudate nucleus of volume 119.9707 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3580.6641 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4101.4160 mm³, the right lateral ventricle of volume 460.1074 mm³, the right thalamus proper of volume 159.5215 mm³ and the right caudate nucleus of volume 137.1094 mm³."
