description
"Weighted MRI visualization size (256, 128, 1) in T2 of the skull of a man of 37 years old, with axial section n°71 starting at the base of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1166.7480 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 2.6367 mm³, the brainstem of volume 217.5293 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1223.4375 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 128, 1) in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°71 starting from the base of the skull. The following elements are present : the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1166.7480 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 2.6367 mm³, the brainstem of volume 217.5293 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1223.4375 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with axial section. We carefully observe slice n°71 beginning from the base of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1166.7480 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 2.6367 mm³, the brainstem of volume 217.5293 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1223.4375 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, of axial section. We observe slice n°71 beginning from the base of the skull. We see clearly: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1166.7480 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 2.6367 mm³, the brainstem of volume 217.5293 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1223.4375 mm³."
"MRI size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old of axial section. The observation focuses on slice n°71 starting from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1166.7480 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 2.6367 mm³, the brainstem of volume 217.5293 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1223.4375 mm³."
