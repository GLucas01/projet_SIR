description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 128, 1) in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°67 starting from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 522.0703 mm³, the brainstem of volume 117.3340 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 512.8418 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) in T2, exposing the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°67 beginning from the base of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 522.0703 mm³, the brainstem of volume 117.3340 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 512.8418 mm³."
"Visualization in weighting T2 of the MRI size (256, 128, 1), showing the head of a man of 37 years old of axial section. Slice n°67 is observed from the base of the skull. The following elements are present : the left cerebellar cortex of volume 522.0703 mm³, the brainstem of volume 117.3340 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 512.8418 mm³."
"MRI representation size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, showing the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°67 initiated from the base of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 522.0703 mm³, the brainstem of volume 117.3340 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 512.8418 mm³."
