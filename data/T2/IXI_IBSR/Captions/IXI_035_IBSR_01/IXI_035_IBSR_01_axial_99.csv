description
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, describing the skull of a man of age  of 37 years old, of axial section n°99 from the base of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 379.6875 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1728.3691 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 572.1680 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1905.0293 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 85.6934 mm³, the brainstem of volume 763.3301 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 275.5371 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2025.0000 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 558.9844 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1927.4414 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, of axial section. The observation is made on slice n°99 starting from the base of the skull.
