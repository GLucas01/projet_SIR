description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) in T2, exposing the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°100 beginning from the base of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 419.2383 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1920.8496 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 526.0254 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1879.9805 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 81.7383 mm³, the brainstem of volume 767.2852 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 340.1367 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2084.3262 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 493.0664 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1952.4902 mm³."
"MRI representation size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, showing the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°100 initiated from the base of the skull.
