description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) in T2, showing the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°158 starting from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3332.8125 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4366.4062 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3773.1445 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4050.0000 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with axial section. We carefully observe slice n°158 beginning from the base of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3332.8125 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4366.4062 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3773.1445 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4050.0000 mm³."
