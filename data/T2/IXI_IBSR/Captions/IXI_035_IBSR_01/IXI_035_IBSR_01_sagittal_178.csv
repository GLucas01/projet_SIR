description
"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in T2, depicting the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°178 beginning from the right hemisphere of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2110.6934 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5871.9727 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 729.0527 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with sagittal section. We observe slice n°178 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2110.6934 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5871.9727 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 729.0527 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of sagittal section. We observe slice n°178 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2110.6934 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5871.9727 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 729.0527 mm³ in it."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256, 1) in T2, revealing the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°178 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2110.6934 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5871.9727 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 729.0527 mm³."
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) size (128, 256, 1) capture representing the head of a man aged  of 37 years old, with a sequence weighted in T2 and sagittal section, starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We observe the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2110.6934 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5871.9727 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 729.0527 mm³ there."
