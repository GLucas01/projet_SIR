description
"Illustration size (256, 128, 1) by MRI of the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°149 starting from the base of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3932.6660 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3919.4824 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 311.1328 mm³, the left caudate nucleus of volume 109.4238 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3790.2832 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4018.3594 mm³, the right lateral ventricle of volume 311.1328 mm³ and the right caudate nucleus of volume 151.6113 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (256, 128, 1) with weighted imaging in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°149 starting from the base of the skull.
