description
"MRI size (256, 256, 1) in weighting T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section. The observation is made on slice n°102 from the back of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 841.1133 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2597.1680 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1197.0703 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2437.6465 mm³."
