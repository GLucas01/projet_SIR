description
"MRI representation size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, showing the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°78 initiated from the base of the skull. We observe the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 47.4609 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1716.5039 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 11.8652 mm³, the brainstem of volume 280.8105 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 13.1836 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1800.8789 mm³ there."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, of axial section n°78. We observe slice n°78 starting from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 47.4609 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1716.5039 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 11.8652 mm³, the brainstem of volume 280.8105 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 13.1836 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1800.8789 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 128, 1) in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°78 starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 47.4609 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1716.5039 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 11.8652 mm³, the brainstem of volume 280.8105 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 13.1836 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1800.8789 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) with weighted imaging in T2, depicting the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°78 beginning from the base of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 47.4609 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1716.5039 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 11.8652 mm³, the brainstem of volume 280.8105 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 13.1836 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1800.8789 mm³."
