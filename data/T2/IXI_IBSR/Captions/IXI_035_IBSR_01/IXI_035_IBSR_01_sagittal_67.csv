"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in weighted T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°67 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 413.9648 mm³ and the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4213.4766 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with sagittal section. We observe slice n°67 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 413.9648 mm³ and the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4213.4766 mm³ in it."
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256, 1) weighted in T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section n°67 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 413.9648 mm³ and the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4213.4766 mm³."
