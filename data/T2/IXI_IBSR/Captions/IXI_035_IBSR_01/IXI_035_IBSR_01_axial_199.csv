description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) in T2, showing the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°199 starting from the base of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 83.0566 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 47.4609 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 128, 1) in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°199 starting from the base of the skull. We see clearly: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 83.0566 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 47.4609 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with axial section. We carefully observe slice n°199 beginning from the base of the skull. The section reveals the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 83.0566 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 47.4609 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (256, 128, 1) with weighted imaging in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°199 starting from the base of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 83.0566 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 47.4609 mm³."
"Weighted MRI visualization size (256, 128, 1) in T2 of the skull of a man of 37 years old, with axial section n°199 starting at the base of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 83.0566 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 47.4609 mm³."
