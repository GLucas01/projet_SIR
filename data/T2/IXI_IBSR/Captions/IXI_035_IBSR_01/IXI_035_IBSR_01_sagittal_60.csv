"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section. The observation is made on slice n°60 from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see clearly: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2027.6367 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) of a human head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with sagittal section. We observe slice n°60 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2027.6367 mm³."
"Magnetic resonance image (MRI) size (128, 256, 1) capturing the head of a man aged  of 37 years old, with a sequence weighted in T2 and sagittal section. The specific slice is number 60, counted from the right hemisphere of the skull. The observed details include the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2027.6367 mm³."
"MRI size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2, showing the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°60 initiated from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see clearly: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2027.6367 mm³."
