description
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256, 1) in T2, exhibiting the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°182 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1149.6094 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5498.8770 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 345.4102 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2 of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°182 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1149.6094 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5498.8770 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 345.4102 mm³ in it."
