description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) visualization in T2 of the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°63 starting at the base of the skull. We see clearly: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 32.9590 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 84.3750 mm³."
"MRI representation size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, showing the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°63 initiated from the base of the skull. We distinguishe the left cerebellar cortex of volume 32.9590 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 84.3750 mm³ in it."

"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, of axial section. We observe slice n°63 beginning from the base of the skull. The following elements are present : the left cerebellar cortex of volume 32.9590 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 84.3750 mm³."
