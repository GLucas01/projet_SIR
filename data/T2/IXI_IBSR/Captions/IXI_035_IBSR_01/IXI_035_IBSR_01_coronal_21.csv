description
"MRI snapshot size (256, 256, 1) with weighting in T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old, in slice coronal n°21 starting from the back of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1406.6895 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3608.3496 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 14.5020 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 98.8770 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1841.7480 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1386.9141 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3319.6289 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 142.3828 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1849.6582 mm³."
