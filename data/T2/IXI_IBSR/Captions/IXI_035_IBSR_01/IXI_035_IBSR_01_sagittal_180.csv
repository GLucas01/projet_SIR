description
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with sagittal section. We observe slice n°180 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1646.6309 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5666.3086 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 547.1191 mm³ in it."
