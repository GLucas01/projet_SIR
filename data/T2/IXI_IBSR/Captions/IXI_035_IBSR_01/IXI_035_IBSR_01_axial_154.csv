description
"Weighted MRI size(256, 128, 1) in T2 illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, with axial section n°154 starting from the base of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4193.7012 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3849.6094 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4080.3223 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3969.5801 mm³, the right lateral ventricle of volume 19.7754 mm³ and the right caudate nucleus of volume 2.6367 mm³."
"Visualization in weighting T2 of the MRI size (256, 128, 1), showing the head of a man of 37 years old of axial section. Slice n°154 is observed from the base of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4193.7012 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3849.6094 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4080.3223 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3969.5801 mm³, the right lateral ventricle of volume 19.7754 mm³ and the right caudate nucleus of volume 2.6367 mm³ in it."
"MRI snapshot size (256, 128, 1) with weighted imaging in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°154 starting from the base of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4193.7012 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3849.6094 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4080.3223 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3969.5801 mm³, the right lateral ventricle of volume 19.7754 mm³ and the right caudate nucleus of volume 2.6367 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, describing the skull of a man of age  of 37 years old, of axial section n°154 from the base of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4193.7012 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3849.6094 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4080.3223 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3969.5801 mm³, the right lateral ventricle of volume 19.7754 mm³ and the right caudate nucleus of volume 2.6367 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with axial section. We carefully observe slice n°154 beginning from the base of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4193.7012 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3849.6094 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4080.3223 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3969.5801 mm³, the right lateral ventricle of volume 19.7754 mm³ and the right caudate nucleus of volume 2.6367 mm³."
