description
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, of axial section. The observation is made on slice n°151 starting from the base of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4101.4160 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3864.1113 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 150.2930 mm³, the left caudate nucleus of volume 64.5996 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4114.5996 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3790.2832 mm³, the right lateral ventricle of volume 160.8398 mm³ and the right caudate nucleus of volume 93.6035 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (256, 128, 1) with weighted imaging in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°151 starting from the base of the skull.
