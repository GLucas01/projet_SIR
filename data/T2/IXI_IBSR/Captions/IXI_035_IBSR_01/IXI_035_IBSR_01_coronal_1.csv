description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, revealing the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°1 beginning from the back of the skull. The following elements are present : the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 424.5117 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 442.9688 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) of a human head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with coronal section. We carefully examine slice n°1 from the back of the skull. The observed details include the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 424.5117 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 442.9688 mm³."
