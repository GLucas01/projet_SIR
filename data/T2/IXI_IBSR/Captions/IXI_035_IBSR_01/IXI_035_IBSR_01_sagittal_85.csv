description
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) of a human head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of sagittal section. We observe slice n°85 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2823.9258 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6978.0762 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 39.5508 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1206.2988 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256, 1) in T2, revealing the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°85 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2823.9258 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6978.0762 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 39.5508 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1206.2988 mm³."
