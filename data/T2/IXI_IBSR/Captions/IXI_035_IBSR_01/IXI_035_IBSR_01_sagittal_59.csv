description
"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in T2, representing the head of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section n°59 beginning from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1280.1270 mm³ in it."
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) weighted in T2, revealing the head of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section n°59 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1280.1270 mm³."
"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in T2, depicting the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°59 beginning from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see clearly: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1280.1270 mm³."
"MRI size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section. The observation is made on slice n°59 from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1280.1270 mm³ in it."
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) size (128, 256, 1) capture representing the head of a man aged  of 37 years old, with a sequence weighted in T2 and sagittal section, starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1280.1270 mm³."
