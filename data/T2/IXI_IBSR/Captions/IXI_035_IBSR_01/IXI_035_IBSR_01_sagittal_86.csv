description
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2 of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section n°86 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3069.1406 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6859.4238 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 61.9629 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1243.2129 mm³."
"MRI size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section. The observation is made on slice n°86 from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3069.1406 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6859.4238 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 61.9629 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1243.2129 mm³."
"MRI size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2, showing the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°86 initiated from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3069.1406 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6859.4238 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 61.9629 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1243.2129 mm³."
