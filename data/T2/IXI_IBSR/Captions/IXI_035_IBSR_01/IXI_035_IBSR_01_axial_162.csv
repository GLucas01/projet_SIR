description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) in T2, showing the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°162 starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2537.8418 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4652.4902 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2522.0215 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4773.7793 mm³ in it."
"Visualization in weighting T2 of the MRI size (256, 128, 1), showing the head of a man of 37 years old of axial section. Slice n°162 is observed from the base of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2537.8418 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4652.4902 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2522.0215 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4773.7793 mm³."
