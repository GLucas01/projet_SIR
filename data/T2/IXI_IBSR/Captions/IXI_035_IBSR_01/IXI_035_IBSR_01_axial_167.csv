description
"MRI snapshot size (256, 128, 1) with weighted imaging in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°167 starting from the base of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2228.0273 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4263.5742 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2315.0391 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4238.5254 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) with weighted imaging in T2, depicting the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°167 beginning from the base of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2228.0273 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4263.5742 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2315.0391 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4238.5254 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, of axial section. We observe slice n°167 beginning from the base of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2228.0273 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4263.5742 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2315.0391 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4238.5254 mm³."
