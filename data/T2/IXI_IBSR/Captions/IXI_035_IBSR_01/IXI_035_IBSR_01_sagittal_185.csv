description
"Image size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2 of the MRI, showing the head of a man of 37 years old of sagittal section. Slice n°185 is observed starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 787.0605 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4773.7793 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 10.5469 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) of a human head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of sagittal section. We observe slice n°185 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 787.0605 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4773.7793 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 10.5469 mm³ in it."
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256, 1) in T2 showing the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°185 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 787.0605 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4773.7793 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 10.5469 mm³."
"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in T2, representing the head of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section n°185 beginning from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 787.0605 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4773.7793 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 10.5469 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256, 1) weighted in T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section n°185 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 787.0605 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4773.7793 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 10.5469 mm³ in it."
