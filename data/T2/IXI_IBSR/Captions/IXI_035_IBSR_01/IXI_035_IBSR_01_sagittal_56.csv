"Weighted MRI size (128, 256, 1) in T2, exhibiting the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°56 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6.5918 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of sagittal section. We observe slice n°56 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6.5918 mm³ in it."
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256, 1) in weighted T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°56 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6.5918 mm³."
