description
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, of axial section. The observation is made on slice n°170 starting from the base of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2005.2246 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4123.8281 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2206.9336 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3959.0332 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2 describing the skull of a man of age  of 37 years old, of axial section n°170 from the base of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2005.2246 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4123.8281 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2206.9336 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3959.0332 mm³."
