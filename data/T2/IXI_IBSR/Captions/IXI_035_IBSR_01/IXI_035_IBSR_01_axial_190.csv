description
"Weighted MRI size(256, 128, 1) in T2 illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, with axial section n°190 starting from the base of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 257.0801 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1802.1973 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 280.8105 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1761.3281 mm³."
"Illustration size (256, 128, 1) by MRI of the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°190 starting from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 257.0801 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1802.1973 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 280.8105 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1761.3281 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) visualization in T2 of the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°190 starting at the base of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 257.0801 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1802.1973 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 280.8105 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1761.3281 mm³."
