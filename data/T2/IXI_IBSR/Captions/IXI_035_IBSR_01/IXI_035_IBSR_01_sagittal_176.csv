description
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) size (128, 256, 1) capture representing the head of a man aged  of 37 years old, with a sequence weighted in T2 and sagittal section, starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2353.2715 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6133.0078 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 892.5293 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of sagittal section. We observe slice n°176 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2353.2715 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6133.0078 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 892.5293 mm³."
