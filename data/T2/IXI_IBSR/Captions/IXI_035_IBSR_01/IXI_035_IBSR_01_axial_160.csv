description
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with axial section. We carefully observe slice n°160 beginning from the base of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2959.7168 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4548.3398 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3066.5039 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4556.2500 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, of axial section. The observation is made on slice n°160 starting from the base of the skull.

"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with axial section. We observe slice n°160 beginning from the base of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2959.7168 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4548.3398 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3066.5039 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4556.2500 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (256, 128, 1) with weighted imaging in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°160 starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2959.7168 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4548.3398 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3066.5039 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4556.2500 mm³ in it."
"Illustration size (256, 128, 1) by MRI of the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°160 starting from the base of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2959.7168 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4548.3398 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3066.5039 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4556.2500 mm³."
