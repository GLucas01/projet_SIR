description
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, of axial section. We observe slice n°176 beginning from the base of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1421.1914 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3692.7246 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1310.4492 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3828.5156 mm³ in it."
"MRI size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, depicting the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°176 starting from the base of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1421.1914 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3692.7246 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1310.4492 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3828.5156 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, describing the skull of a man of age  of 37 years old, of axial section n°176 from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1421.1914 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3692.7246 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1310.4492 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3828.5156 mm³."
"Illustration size (256, 128, 1) by MRI of the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°176 starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1421.1914 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3692.7246 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1310.4492 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3828.5156 mm³ in it."
