description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) in T2, exposing the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°72 beginning from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1291.9922 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 6.5918 mm³, the brainstem of volume 228.0762 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1326.2695 mm³."
"Illustration size (256, 128, 1) by MRI of the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°72 starting from the base of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1291.9922 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 6.5918 mm³, the brainstem of volume 228.0762 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1326.2695 mm³."
