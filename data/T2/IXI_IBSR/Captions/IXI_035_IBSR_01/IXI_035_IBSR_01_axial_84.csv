description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) in T2, showing the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°84 starting from the base of the skull. The observed details include: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 164.7949 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 371.7773 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1845.7031 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 9.2285 mm³, the brainstem of volume 373.0957 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 255.7617 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 511.5234 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1723.0957 mm³."
"MRI representation size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, showing the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°84 initiated from the base of the skull. The observed details include the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 164.7949 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 371.7773 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1845.7031 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 9.2285 mm³, the brainstem of volume 373.0957 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 255.7617 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 511.5234 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1723.0957 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with axial section. We carefully observe slice n°84 beginning from the base of the skull. We observe the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 164.7949 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 371.7773 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1845.7031 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 9.2285 mm³, the brainstem of volume 373.0957 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 255.7617 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 511.5234 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1723.0957 mm³ there."
"Weighted MRI visualization size (256, 128, 1) in T2 of the skull of a man of 37 years old, with axial section n°84 starting at the base of the skull. The observed details include the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 164.7949 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 371.7773 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1845.7031 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 9.2285 mm³, the brainstem of volume 373.0957 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 255.7617 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 511.5234 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1723.0957 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) visualization in T2 of the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°84 starting at the base of the skull. We distinguishe the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 164.7949 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 371.7773 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1845.7031 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 9.2285 mm³, the brainstem of volume 373.0957 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 255.7617 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 511.5234 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1723.0957 mm³ in it."
