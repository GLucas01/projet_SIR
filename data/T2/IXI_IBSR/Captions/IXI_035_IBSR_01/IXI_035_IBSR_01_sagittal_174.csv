description
"Magnetic resonance image (MRI) size (128, 256, 1) capturing the head of a man aged  of 37 years old, with a sequence weighted in T2 and sagittal section. The specific slice is number 174, counted from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2631.4453 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6375.5859 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 1.3184 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1015.1367 mm³."
