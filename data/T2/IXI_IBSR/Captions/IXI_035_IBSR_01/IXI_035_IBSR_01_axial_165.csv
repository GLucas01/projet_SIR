description
"Weighted MRI size(256, 128, 1) in T2 illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, with axial section n°165 starting from the base of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2324.2676 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4470.5566 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2346.6797 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4465.2832 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 128, 1) in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°165 starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2324.2676 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4470.5566 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2346.6797 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4465.2832 mm³ in it."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, of axial section n°165. We observe slice n°165 starting from the base of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2324.2676 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4470.5566 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2346.6797 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4465.2832 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with axial section. We carefully observe slice n°165 beginning from the base of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2324.2676 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4470.5566 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2346.6797 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4465.2832 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) visualization in T2 of the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°165 starting at the base of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2324.2676 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4470.5566 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2346.6797 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4465.2832 mm³."
