description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) in T2, exposing the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°193 beginning from the base of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 51.4160 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1204.9805 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 97.5586 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1203.6621 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with axial section. We carefully observe slice n°193 beginning from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 51.4160 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1204.9805 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 97.5586 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1203.6621 mm³."
"MRI representation size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, showing the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°193 initiated from the base of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 51.4160 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1204.9805 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 97.5586 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1203.6621 mm³."
"Weighted MRI visualization size (256, 128, 1) in T2 of the skull of a man of 37 years old, with axial section n°193 starting at the base of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 51.4160 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1204.9805 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 97.5586 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1203.6621 mm³."
