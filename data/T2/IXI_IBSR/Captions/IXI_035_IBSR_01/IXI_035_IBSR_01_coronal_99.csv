description
"MRI size (256, 256, 1) in weighting T2, showing the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°99 initiated from the back of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1098.1934 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2701.3184 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1311.7676 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2734.2773 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°99 starting from the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1098.1934 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2701.3184 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1311.7676 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2734.2773 mm³."
