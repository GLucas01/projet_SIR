description
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, of axial section. We observe slice n°94 beginning from the base of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 56.6895 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1175.9766 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 823.9746 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1786.3770 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 40.8691 mm³, the brainstem of volume 685.5469 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 71.1914 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1248.4863 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 796.2891 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1877.3438 mm³."
"MRI size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, depicting the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°94 starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 56.6895 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1175.9766 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 823.9746 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1786.3770 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 40.8691 mm³, the brainstem of volume 685.5469 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 71.1914 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1248.4863 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 796.2891 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1877.3438 mm³ in it."
