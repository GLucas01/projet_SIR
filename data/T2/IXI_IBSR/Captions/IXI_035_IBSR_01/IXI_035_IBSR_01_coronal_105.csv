description
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with coronal section. We carefully observe slice n°105 beginning from the back of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 710.5957 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2300.5371 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 805.5176 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2394.1406 mm³."

"Weighted MRI image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, representing the head of a man of 37 years old, with coronal section n°105 starting at the back of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 710.5957 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2300.5371 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 805.5176 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2394.1406 mm³ in it."
