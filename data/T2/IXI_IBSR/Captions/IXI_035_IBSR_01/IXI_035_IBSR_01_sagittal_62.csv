description
"MRI size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section. The observation is made on slice n°62 from the right hemisphere of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 46.1426 mm³ and the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2955.7617 mm³."
