description
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) with weighted imaging in T2, depicting the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°96 beginning from the base of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 163.4766 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1389.5508 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 656.5430 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1972.2656 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 84.3750 mm³, the brainstem of volume 722.4609 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 210.9375 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1454.1504 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 704.0039 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1920.8496 mm³."
