description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) in T2, showing the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°159 starting from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3162.7441 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4461.3281 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3386.8652 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4341.3574 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, of axial section n°159. We observe slice n°159 starting from the base of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3162.7441 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4461.3281 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3386.8652 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4341.3574 mm³."
