description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 256, 1) in T2, exposing the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°103 starting from the back of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 789.6973 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2527.2949 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1092.9199 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2407.3242 mm³ in it."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, revealing the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°103 beginning from the back of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 789.6973 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2527.2949 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1092.9199 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2407.3242 mm³ there."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°103 starting from the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 789.6973 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2527.2949 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1092.9199 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2407.3242 mm³."
