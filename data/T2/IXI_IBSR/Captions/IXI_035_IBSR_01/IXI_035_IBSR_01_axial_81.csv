description
"MRI snapshot size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2 describing the skull of a man of age  of 37 years old, of axial section n°81 from the base of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 58.0078 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1951.1719 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 6.5918 mm³, the brainstem of volume 301.9043 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 11.8652 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 118.6523 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1898.4375 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, of axial section n°81. We observe slice n°81 starting from the base of the skull. We observe the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 58.0078 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1951.1719 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 6.5918 mm³, the brainstem of volume 301.9043 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 11.8652 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 118.6523 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1898.4375 mm³ there."
"Weighted MRI visualization size (256, 128, 1) in T2 of the skull of a man of 37 years old, with axial section n°81 starting at the base of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 58.0078 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1951.1719 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 6.5918 mm³, the brainstem of volume 301.9043 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 11.8652 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 118.6523 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1898.4375 mm³."
