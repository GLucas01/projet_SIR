description
"MRI size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, depicting the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°163 starting from the base of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2462.6953 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4627.4414 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2384.9121 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4743.4570 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) visualization in T2 of the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°163 starting at the base of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2462.6953 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4627.4414 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2384.9121 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4743.4570 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, describing the skull of a man of age  of 37 years old, of axial section n°163 from the base of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2462.6953 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4627.4414 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2384.9121 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4743.4570 mm³."
"Illustration size (256, 128, 1) by MRI of the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°163 starting from the base of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2462.6953 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4627.4414 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2384.9121 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4743.4570 mm³ there."
