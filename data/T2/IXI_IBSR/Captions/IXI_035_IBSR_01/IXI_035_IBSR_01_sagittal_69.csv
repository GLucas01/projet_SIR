description
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2 of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section n°69 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 715.8691 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4606.3477 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 47.4609 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2 of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section n°69 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 715.8691 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4606.3477 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 47.4609 mm³."
"Magnetic resonance image (MRI) size (128, 256, 1) capturing the head of a man aged  of 37 years old, with a sequence weighted in T2 and sagittal section. The specific slice is number 69, counted from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 715.8691 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4606.3477 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 47.4609 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with sagittal section. We observe slice n°69 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 715.8691 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4606.3477 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 47.4609 mm³."
