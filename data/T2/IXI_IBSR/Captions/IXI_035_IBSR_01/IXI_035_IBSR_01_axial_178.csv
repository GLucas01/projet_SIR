description
"Weighted MRI visualization size (256, 128, 1) in T2 of the skull of a man of 37 years old, with axial section n°178 starting at the base of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1309.1309 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3473.8770 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1185.2051 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3530.5664 mm³."
"Illustration size (256, 128, 1) by MRI of the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°178 starting from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1309.1309 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3473.8770 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1185.2051 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3530.5664 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) in T2, showing the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°178 starting from the base of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1309.1309 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3473.8770 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1185.2051 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3530.5664 mm³ there."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with axial section. We observe slice n°178 beginning from the base of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1309.1309 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3473.8770 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1185.2051 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3530.5664 mm³."
"MRI representation size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, showing the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°178 initiated from the base of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1309.1309 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3473.8770 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1185.2051 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3530.5664 mm³."
