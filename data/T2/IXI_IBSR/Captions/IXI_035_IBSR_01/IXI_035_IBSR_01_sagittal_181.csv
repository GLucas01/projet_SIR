description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256, 1) in T2, revealing the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°181 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1398.7793 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5571.3867 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 445.6055 mm³."
"MRI size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old of sagittal section. The observation focuses on slice n°181 from the right hemisphere of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1398.7793 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5571.3867 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 445.6055 mm³."
