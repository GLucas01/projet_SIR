description
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2 of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°187 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 543.1641 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4332.1289 mm³."
"Magnetic resonance image (MRI) size (128, 256, 1) capturing the head of a man aged  of 37 years old, with a sequence weighted in T2 and sagittal section. The specific slice is number 187, counted from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 543.1641 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4332.1289 mm³."
"MRI size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old of sagittal section. The observation focuses on slice n°187 from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 543.1641 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4332.1289 mm³."
"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in T2, representing the head of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section n°187 beginning from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 543.1641 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4332.1289 mm³."
"Image size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2 of the MRI, showing the head of a man of 37 years old of sagittal section. Slice n°187 is observed starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 543.1641 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4332.1289 mm³."
