description
"MRI size (256, 256, 1) in weighting T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section. The observation is made on slice n°32 from the back of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2006.5430 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3953.7598 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 47.4609 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 526.0254 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 2681.5430 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1740.2344 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4002.5391 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 512.8418 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 2717.1387 mm³."
