description
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256, 1) in T2 showing the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°81 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2423.1445 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6673.5352 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 1.3184 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1016.4551 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256, 1) weighted in T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section n°81 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2423.1445 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6673.5352 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 1.3184 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1016.4551 mm³."
