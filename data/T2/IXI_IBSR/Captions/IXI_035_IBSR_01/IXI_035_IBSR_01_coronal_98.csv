description
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of coronal section. We observe slice n°98 beginning from the back of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1247.1680 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2730.3223 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1355.2734 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2830.5176 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, revealing the head of a man of 37 years old, with coronal section n°98 initiated from the back of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1247.1680 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2730.3223 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1355.2734 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2830.5176 mm³."
