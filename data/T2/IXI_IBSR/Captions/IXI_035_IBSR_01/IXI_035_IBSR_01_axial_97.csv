description
"MRI size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, depicting the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°97 starting from the base of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 239.9414 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1497.6562 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 606.4453 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1988.0859 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 87.0117 mm³, the brainstem of volume 742.2363 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 233.3496 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1653.2227 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 685.5469 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1897.1191 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) in T2, showing the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°97 starting from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 239.9414 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1497.6562 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 606.4453 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1988.0859 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 87.0117 mm³, the brainstem of volume 742.2363 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 233.3496 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1653.2227 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 685.5469 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1897.1191 mm³."
"Illustration size (256, 128, 1) by MRI of the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°97 starting from the base of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 239.9414 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1497.6562 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 606.4453 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1988.0859 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 87.0117 mm³, the brainstem of volume 742.2363 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 233.3496 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1653.2227 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 685.5469 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1897.1191 mm³ there."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) visualization in T2 of the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°97 starting at the base of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 239.9414 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1497.6562 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 606.4453 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1988.0859 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 87.0117 mm³, the brainstem of volume 742.2363 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 233.3496 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1653.2227 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 685.5469 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1897.1191 mm³ in it."
"Image size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2 of the MRI, showing the head of a man of 37 years old of axial section. Slice n°97 is observed starting from the base of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 239.9414 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1497.6562 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 606.4453 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1988.0859 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 87.0117 mm³, the brainstem of volume 742.2363 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 233.3496 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1653.2227 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 685.5469 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1897.1191 mm³."
