description
"MRI size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old of axial section. The observation focuses on slice n°169 starting from the base of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2032.9102 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4226.6602 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2238.5742 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4015.7227 mm³."
