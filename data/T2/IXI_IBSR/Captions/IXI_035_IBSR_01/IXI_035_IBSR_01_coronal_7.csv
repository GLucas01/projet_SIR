description
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of coronal section. We observe slice n°7 beginning from the back of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 536.5723 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1940.6250 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 470.6543 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1778.4668 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 256, 1) in T2, exhibiting the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°7 starting from the back of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 536.5723 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1940.6250 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 470.6543 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1778.4668 mm³."
