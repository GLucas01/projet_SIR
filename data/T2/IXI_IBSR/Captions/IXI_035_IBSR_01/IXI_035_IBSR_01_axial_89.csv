description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) in T2, showing the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°89 starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 773.8770 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 701.3672 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1792.9688 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 10.5469 mm³, the brainstem of volume 572.1680 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2.6367 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 909.6680 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 804.1992 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1678.2715 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, of axial section. We observe slice n°89 beginning from the base of the skull. We see the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 773.8770 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 701.3672 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1792.9688 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 10.5469 mm³, the brainstem of volume 572.1680 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2.6367 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 909.6680 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 804.1992 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1678.2715 mm³."
