description
"MRI size (256, 256, 1) in weighting T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old of coronal section. The observation focuses on slice n°115 from the back of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 127.8809 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 955.8105 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 159.5215 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1131.1523 mm³."
