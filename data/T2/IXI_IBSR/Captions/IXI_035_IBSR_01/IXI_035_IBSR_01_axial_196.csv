description
"MRI size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, depicting the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°196 starting from the base of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 474.6094 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 500.9766 mm³."
"Weighted MRI visualization size (256, 128, 1) in T2 of the skull of a man of 37 years old, with axial section n°196 starting at the base of the skull. The section reveals the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 474.6094 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 500.9766 mm³."

"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with axial section. We carefully observe slice n°196 beginning from the base of the skull. We distinguishe the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 474.6094 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 500.9766 mm³ in it."
