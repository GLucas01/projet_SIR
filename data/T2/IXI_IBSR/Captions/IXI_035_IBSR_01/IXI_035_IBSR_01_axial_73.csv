description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 128, 1) in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°73 starting from the base of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 1.3184 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1386.9141 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 9.2285 mm³, the brainstem of volume 237.3047 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1426.4648 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, of axial section. We observe slice n°73 beginning from the base of the skull. We see the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 1.3184 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1386.9141 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 9.2285 mm³, the brainstem of volume 237.3047 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1426.4648 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with axial section. We carefully observe slice n°73 beginning from the base of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 1.3184 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1386.9141 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 9.2285 mm³, the brainstem of volume 237.3047 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1426.4648 mm³."
