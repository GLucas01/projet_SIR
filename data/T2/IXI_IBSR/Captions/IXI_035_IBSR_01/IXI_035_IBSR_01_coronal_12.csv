description
"MRI size (256, 256, 1) in weighting T2, showing the head of a man of 37 years old, with coronal section n°12 starting from the back of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 904.3945 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2566.8457 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 473.2910 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 719.8242 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2460.0586 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 656.5430 mm³."
"MRI size (256, 256, 1) in weighting T2, showing the head of a man of 37 years old, with coronal section n°12 starting from the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 904.3945 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2566.8457 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 473.2910 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 719.8242 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2460.0586 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 656.5430 mm³."
