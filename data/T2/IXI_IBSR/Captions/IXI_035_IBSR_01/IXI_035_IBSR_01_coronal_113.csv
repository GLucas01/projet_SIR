description
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with coronal section. We carefully observe slice n°113 beginning from the back of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 371.7773 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1165.4297 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 474.6094 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1204.9805 mm³."
"MRI size (256, 256, 1) in weighting T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old of coronal section. The observation focuses on slice n°113 from the back of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 371.7773 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1165.4297 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 474.6094 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1204.9805 mm³ in it."
