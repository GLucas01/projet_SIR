description
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2 of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section n°90 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4239.8438 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6126.4160 mm³, the temporal horn of left lateral ventricle of volume 11.8652 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 123.9258 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1364.5020 mm³ and the left hippocampus of volume 67.2363 mm³."
"MRI size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section. The observation is made on slice n°90 from the right hemisphere of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4239.8438 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6126.4160 mm³, the temporal horn of left lateral ventricle of volume 11.8652 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 123.9258 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1364.5020 mm³ and the left hippocampus of volume 67.2363 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256, 1) weighted in T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section n°90 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4239.8438 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6126.4160 mm³, the temporal horn of left lateral ventricle of volume 11.8652 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 123.9258 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1364.5020 mm³ and the left hippocampus of volume 67.2363 mm³."
