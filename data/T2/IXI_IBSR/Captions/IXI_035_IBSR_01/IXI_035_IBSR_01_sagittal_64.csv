description
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256, 1) in T2 showing the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°64 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 125.2441 mm³ and the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3667.6758 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in weighted T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°64 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 125.2441 mm³ and the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3667.6758 mm³."
