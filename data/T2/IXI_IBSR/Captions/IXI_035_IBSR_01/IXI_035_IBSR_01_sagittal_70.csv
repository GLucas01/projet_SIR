description
"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in T2, depicting the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°70 beginning from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 827.9297 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4931.9824 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 119.9707 mm³."
"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in T2, representing the head of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section n°70 beginning from the right hemisphere of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 827.9297 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4931.9824 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 119.9707 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of sagittal section. We observe slice n°70 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 827.9297 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4931.9824 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 119.9707 mm³."
