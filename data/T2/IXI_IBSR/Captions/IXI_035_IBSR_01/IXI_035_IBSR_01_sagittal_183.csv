description
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) of a human head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of sagittal section. We observe slice n°183 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 972.9492 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5294.5312 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 220.1660 mm³."
