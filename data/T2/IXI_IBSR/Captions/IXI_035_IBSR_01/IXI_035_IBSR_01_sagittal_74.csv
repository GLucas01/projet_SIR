description
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) of a human head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with sagittal section. We observe slice n°74 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1442.2852 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5800.7812 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 510.2051 mm³ there."
