description
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, of axial section. The observation is made on slice n°66 starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 321.6797 mm³, the brainstem of volume 87.0117 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 308.4961 mm³."
