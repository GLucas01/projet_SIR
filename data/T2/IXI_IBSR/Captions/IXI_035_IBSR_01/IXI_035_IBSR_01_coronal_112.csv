description
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with coronal section. We observe slice n°112 starting at the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 384.9609 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1322.3145 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 458.7891 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1508.2031 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) of a human head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of coronal section. We observe slice n°112 starting from the back of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 384.9609 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1322.3145 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 458.7891 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1508.2031 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 256, 1) in T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, with coronal sectionn°112 beginning at the back of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 384.9609 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1322.3145 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 458.7891 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1508.2031 mm³."
