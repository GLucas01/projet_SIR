description
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with sagittal section. We observe slice n°88 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3647.9004 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6495.5566 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 92.2852 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1303.8574 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) of a human head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with sagittal section. We observe slice n°88 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3647.9004 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6495.5566 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 92.2852 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1303.8574 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256, 1) in T2, revealing the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°88 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3647.9004 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6495.5566 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 92.2852 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1303.8574 mm³."
