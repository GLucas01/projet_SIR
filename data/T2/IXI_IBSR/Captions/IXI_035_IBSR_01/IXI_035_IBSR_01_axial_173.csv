description
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, of axial section. The observation is made on slice n°173 starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1727.0508 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3856.2012 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1698.0469 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4030.2246 mm³ in it."
