description
"Weighted MRI visualization size (256, 128, 1) in T2 of the skull of a man of 37 years old, with axial section n°189 starting at the base of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 309.8145 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2075.0977 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 340.1367 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1931.3965 mm³."
