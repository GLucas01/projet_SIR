description
"MRI size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old of sagittal section. The observation focuses on slice n°196 from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 445.6055 mm³ in it."
"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in T2, depicting the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°196 beginning from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 445.6055 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256, 1) in T2, revealing the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°196 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We observe the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 445.6055 mm³ there."
