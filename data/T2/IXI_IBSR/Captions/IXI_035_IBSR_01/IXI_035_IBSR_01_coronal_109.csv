description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 256, 1) in T2, exhibiting the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°109 starting from the back of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 591.9434 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1761.3281 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 747.5098 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1890.5273 mm³."
"Weighted MRI image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, representing the head of a man of 37 years old, with coronal section n°109 starting at the back of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 591.9434 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1761.3281 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 747.5098 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1890.5273 mm³ there."
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with coronal section. We observe slice n°109 starting at the back of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 591.9434 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1761.3281 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 747.5098 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1890.5273 mm³ in it."
"MRI size (256, 256, 1) in weighting T2, showing the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°109 initiated from the back of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 591.9434 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1761.3281 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 747.5098 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1890.5273 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) of a human head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of coronal section. We observe slice n°109 starting from the back of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 591.9434 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1761.3281 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 747.5098 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1890.5273 mm³."
