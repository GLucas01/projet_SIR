description
"Weighted MRI visualization size (256, 128, 1) in T2 of the skull of a man of 37 years old, with axial section n°172 starting at the base of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1861.5234 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3889.1602 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1905.0293 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3986.7188 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) in T2, showing the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°172 starting from the base of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1861.5234 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3889.1602 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1905.0293 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3986.7188 mm³ there."
"MRI size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old of axial section. The observation focuses on slice n°172 starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1861.5234 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3889.1602 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1905.0293 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3986.7188 mm³ in it."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, of axial section n°172. We observe slice n°172 starting from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1861.5234 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3889.1602 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1905.0293 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3986.7188 mm³."
