description
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, of axial section n°79. We observe slice n°79 starting from the base of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 50.0977 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1799.5605 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 10.5469 mm³, the brainstem of volume 287.4023 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 32.9590 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1843.0664 mm³."

"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) visualization in T2 of the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°79 starting at the base of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 50.0977 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1799.5605 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 10.5469 mm³, the brainstem of volume 287.4023 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 32.9590 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1843.0664 mm³."
"Visualization in weighting T2 of the MRI size (256, 128, 1), showing the head of a man of 37 years old of axial section. Slice n°79 is observed from the base of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 50.0977 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1799.5605 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 10.5469 mm³, the brainstem of volume 287.4023 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 32.9590 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1843.0664 mm³ in it."
