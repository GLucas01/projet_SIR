description
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256, 1) weighted in T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section n°79 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2424.4629 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6280.6641 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 871.4355 mm³."
