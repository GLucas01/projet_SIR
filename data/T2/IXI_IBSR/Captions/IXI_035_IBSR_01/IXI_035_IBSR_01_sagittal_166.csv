description
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in weighted T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°166 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4201.6113 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6314.9414 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 114.6973 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1411.9629 mm³."
"Magnetic resonance image (MRI) size (128, 256, 1) capturing the head of a man aged  of 37 years old, with a sequence weighted in T2 and sagittal section. The specific slice is number 166, counted from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4201.6113 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6314.9414 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 114.6973 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1411.9629 mm³."
