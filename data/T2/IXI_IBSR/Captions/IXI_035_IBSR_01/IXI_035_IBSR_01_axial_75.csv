description
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, describing the skull of a man of age  of 37 years old, of axial section n°75 from the base of the skull. We see the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 13.1836 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1535.8887 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 11.8652 mm³, the brainstem of volume 250.4883 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 2.6367 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1596.5332 mm³."
"Image size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2 of the MRI, showing the head of a man of 37 years old of axial section. Slice n°75 is observed starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 13.1836 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1535.8887 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 11.8652 mm³, the brainstem of volume 250.4883 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 2.6367 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1596.5332 mm³ in it."
