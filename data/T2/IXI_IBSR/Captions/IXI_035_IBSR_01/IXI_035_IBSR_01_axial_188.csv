description
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, of axial section n°188. We observe slice n°188 starting from the base of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 363.8672 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2286.0352 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 461.4258 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2027.6367 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with axial section. We carefully observe slice n°188 beginning from the base of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 363.8672 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2286.0352 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 461.4258 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2027.6367 mm³."
