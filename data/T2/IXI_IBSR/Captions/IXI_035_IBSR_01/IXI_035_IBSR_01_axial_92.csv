description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) in T2, showing the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°92 starting from the base of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 25.0488 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1040.1855 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 860.8887 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1711.2305 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 6.5918 mm³, the brainstem of volume 665.7715 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 15.8203 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1107.4219 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 942.6270 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1672.9980 mm³."
"Illustration size (256, 128, 1) by MRI of the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°92 starting from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 25.0488 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1040.1855 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 860.8887 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1711.2305 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 6.5918 mm³, the brainstem of volume 665.7715 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 15.8203 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1107.4219 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 942.6270 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1672.9980 mm³."

"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) visualization in T2 of the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°92 starting at the base of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 25.0488 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1040.1855 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 860.8887 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1711.2305 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 6.5918 mm³, the brainstem of volume 665.7715 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 15.8203 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1107.4219 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 942.6270 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1672.9980 mm³ in it."
