description
"MRI snapshot size (256, 256, 1) with weighting in T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old, in slice coronal n°87 starting from the back of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2081.6895 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3418.5059 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 90.9668 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2147.6074 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3523.9746 mm³ and the right lateral ventricle of volume 94.9219 mm³."
