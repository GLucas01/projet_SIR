description
"Magnetic resonance image (MRI) size (128, 256, 1) capturing the head of a man aged  of 37 years old, with a sequence weighted in T2 and sagittal section. The specific slice is number 186, counted from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 667.0898 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4560.2051 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256, 1) in T2, exhibiting the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°186 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 667.0898 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4560.2051 mm³."
"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in T2, representing the head of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section n°186 beginning from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 667.0898 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4560.2051 mm³."
