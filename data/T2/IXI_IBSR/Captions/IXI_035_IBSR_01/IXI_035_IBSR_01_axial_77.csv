description
"Illustration size (256, 128, 1) by MRI of the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°77 starting from the base of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 39.5508 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1647.9492 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 13.1836 mm³, the brainstem of volume 272.9004 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 3.9551 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1737.5977 mm³."
