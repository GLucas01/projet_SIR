description
"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in T2, depicting the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°171 beginning from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3129.7852 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6569.3848 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 21.0938 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1197.0703 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256, 1) in T2, exhibiting the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°171 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3129.7852 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6569.3848 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 21.0938 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1197.0703 mm³."
"Magnetic resonance image (MRI) size (128, 256, 1) capturing the head of a man aged  of 37 years old, with a sequence weighted in T2 and sagittal section. The specific slice is number 171, counted from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3129.7852 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6569.3848 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 21.0938 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1197.0703 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) of a human head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of sagittal section. We observe slice n°171 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3129.7852 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6569.3848 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 21.0938 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1197.0703 mm³."
