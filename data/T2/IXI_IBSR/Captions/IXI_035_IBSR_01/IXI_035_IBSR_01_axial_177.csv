description
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) with weighted imaging in T2, depicting the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°177 beginning from the base of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1386.9141 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3555.6152 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1247.1680 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3663.7207 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, of axial section. We observe slice n°177 beginning from the base of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1386.9141 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3555.6152 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1247.1680 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3663.7207 mm³."
