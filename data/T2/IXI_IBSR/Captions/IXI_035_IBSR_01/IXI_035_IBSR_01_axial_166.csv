description
"MRI snapshot size (256, 128, 1) with weighted imaging in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°166 starting from the base of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2276.8066 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4325.5371 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2346.6797 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4341.3574 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (256, 128, 1) with weighted imaging in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°166 starting from the base of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2276.8066 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4325.5371 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2346.6797 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4341.3574 mm³."
"Illustration size (256, 128, 1) by MRI of the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°166 starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2276.8066 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4325.5371 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2346.6797 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4341.3574 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, of axial section. The observation is made on slice n°166 starting from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2276.8066 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4325.5371 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2346.6797 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4341.3574 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with axial section. We carefully observe slice n°166 beginning from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2276.8066 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4325.5371 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2346.6797 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4341.3574 mm³."
