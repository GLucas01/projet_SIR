description
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, of axial section. We observe slice n°153 beginning from the base of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4204.2480 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3864.1113 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 17.1387 mm³, the left caudate nucleus of volume 13.1836 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4176.5625 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3836.4258 mm³, the right lateral ventricle of volume 68.5547 mm³ and the right caudate nucleus of volume 22.4121 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) in T2, exposing the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°153 beginning from the base of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4204.2480 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3864.1113 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 17.1387 mm³, the left caudate nucleus of volume 13.1836 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4176.5625 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3836.4258 mm³, the right lateral ventricle of volume 68.5547 mm³ and the right caudate nucleus of volume 22.4121 mm³."
"Visualization in weighting T2 of the MRI size (256, 128, 1), showing the head of a man of 37 years old of axial section. Slice n°153 is observed from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4204.2480 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3864.1113 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 17.1387 mm³, the left caudate nucleus of volume 13.1836 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4176.5625 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3836.4258 mm³, the right lateral ventricle of volume 68.5547 mm³ and the right caudate nucleus of volume 22.4121 mm³."
