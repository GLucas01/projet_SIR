description
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) of a human head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with sagittal section. We observe slice n°172 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We observe the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2975.5371 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6510.0586 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 11.8652 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1133.7891 mm³ there."
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) size (128, 256, 1) capture representing the head of a man aged  of 37 years old, with a sequence weighted in T2 and sagittal section, starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2975.5371 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6510.0586 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 11.8652 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1133.7891 mm³."
"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in T2, depicting the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°172 beginning from the right hemisphere of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2975.5371 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6510.0586 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 11.8652 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1133.7891 mm³."
