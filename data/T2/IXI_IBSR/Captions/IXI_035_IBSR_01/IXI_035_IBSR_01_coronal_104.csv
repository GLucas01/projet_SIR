description
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of coronal section. We observe slice n°104 beginning from the back of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 789.6973 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2527.2949 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1092.9199 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2406.0059 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with coronal section. We carefully observe slice n°104 beginning from the back of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 789.6973 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2527.2949 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1092.9199 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2406.0059 mm³."
