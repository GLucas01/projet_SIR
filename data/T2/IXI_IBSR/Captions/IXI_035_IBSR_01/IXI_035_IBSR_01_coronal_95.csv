description
"MRI size (256, 256, 1) in weighting T2, showing the head of a man of 37 years old, with coronal section n°95 starting from the back of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1526.6602 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2855.5664 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1629.4922 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2883.2520 mm³."
"MRI size (256, 256, 1) in weighting T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, with coronal section. The observation is made on slice n°95 from the back of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1526.6602 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2855.5664 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1629.4922 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2883.2520 mm³."
