description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, revealing the head of a man of 37 years old, with coronal section n°89 initiated from the back of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2159.4727 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3046.7285 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 18.4570 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2216.1621 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3214.1602 mm³ and the right lateral ventricle of volume 32.9590 mm³."

"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of coronal section. We observe slice n°89 starting from the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2159.4727 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3046.7285 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 18.4570 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2216.1621 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3214.1602 mm³ and the right lateral ventricle of volume 32.9590 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of coronal section. We observe slice n°89 beginning from the back of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2159.4727 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3046.7285 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 18.4570 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2216.1621 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3214.1602 mm³ and the right lateral ventricle of volume 32.9590 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 256, 1) in T2, exposing the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°89 starting from the back of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2159.4727 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3046.7285 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 18.4570 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2216.1621 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3214.1602 mm³ and the right lateral ventricle of volume 32.9590 mm³."
