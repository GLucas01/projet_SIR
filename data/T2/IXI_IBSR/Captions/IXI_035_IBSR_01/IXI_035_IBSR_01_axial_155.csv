description
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with axial section. We observe slice n°155 beginning from the base of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3980.1270 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3978.8086 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3969.5801 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4040.7715 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) with weighted imaging in T2, depicting the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°155 beginning from the base of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3980.1270 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3978.8086 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3969.5801 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4040.7715 mm³ there."
"Visualization in weighting T2 of the MRI size (256, 128, 1), showing the head of a man of 37 years old of axial section. Slice n°155 is observed from the base of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3980.1270 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3978.8086 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3969.5801 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4040.7715 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, of axial section. We observe slice n°155 beginning from the base of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3980.1270 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3978.8086 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3969.5801 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4040.7715 mm³."
"Image size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2 of the MRI, showing the head of a man of 37 years old of axial section. Slice n°155 is observed starting from the base of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3980.1270 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3978.8086 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3969.5801 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4040.7715 mm³."
