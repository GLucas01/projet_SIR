description
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256, 1) in T2 showing the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°175 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2489.0625 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6245.0684 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 950.5371 mm³."
