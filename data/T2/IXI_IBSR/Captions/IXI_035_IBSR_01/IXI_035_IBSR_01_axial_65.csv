description
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, of axial section n°65. We observe slice n°65 starting from the base of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 166.1133 mm³, the brainstem of volume 59.3262 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 206.9824 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 128, 1) in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°65 starting from the base of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 166.1133 mm³, the brainstem of volume 59.3262 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 206.9824 mm³."
