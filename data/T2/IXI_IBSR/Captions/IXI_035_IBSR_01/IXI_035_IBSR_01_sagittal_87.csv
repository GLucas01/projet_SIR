description
"MRI size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section. The observation is made on slice n°87 from the right hemisphere of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3311.7188 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6728.9062 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 75.1465 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1269.5801 mm³."
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) size (128, 256, 1) capture representing the head of a man aged  of 37 years old, with a sequence weighted in T2 and sagittal section, starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3311.7188 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6728.9062 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 75.1465 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1269.5801 mm³."
"Magnetic resonance image (MRI) size (128, 256, 1) capturing the head of a man aged  of 37 years old, with a sequence weighted in T2 and sagittal section.
