description
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of sagittal section. We observe slice n°165 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4321.5820 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6304.3945 mm³, the temporal horn of right lateral ventricle of volume 2.6367 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 133.1543 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1446.2402 mm³ and the right hippocampus of volume 25.0488 mm³."
