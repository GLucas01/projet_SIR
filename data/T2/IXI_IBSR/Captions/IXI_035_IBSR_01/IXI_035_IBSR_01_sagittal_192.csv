"MRI size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2, showing the head of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section n°192 initiated from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 32.9590 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3075.7324 mm³."
