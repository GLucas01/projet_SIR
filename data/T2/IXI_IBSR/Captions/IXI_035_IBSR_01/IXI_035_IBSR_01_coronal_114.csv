description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, revealing the head of a man of 37 years old, with coronal section n°114 initiated from the back of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 242.5781 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1116.6504 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 346.7285 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1114.0137 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 256, 1) in T2, exposing the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°114 starting from the back of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 242.5781 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1116.6504 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 346.7285 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1114.0137 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of coronal section. We observe slice n°114 starting from the back of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 242.5781 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1116.6504 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 346.7285 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1114.0137 mm³."
