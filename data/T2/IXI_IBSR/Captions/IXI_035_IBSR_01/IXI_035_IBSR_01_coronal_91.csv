description
"MRI snapshot size (256, 256, 1) with weighting in T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old, in slice coronal n°91 starting from the back of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1902.3926 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2837.1094 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1985.4492 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2963.6719 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 256, 1) in T2, exposing the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°91 starting from the back of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1902.3926 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2837.1094 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1985.4492 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2963.6719 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°91 starting from the back of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1902.3926 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2837.1094 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1985.4492 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2963.6719 mm³."
