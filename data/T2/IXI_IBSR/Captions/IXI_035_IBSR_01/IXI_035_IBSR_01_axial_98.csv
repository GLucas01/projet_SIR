description
"MRI representation size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, showing the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°98 initiated from the base of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 334.8633 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1576.7578 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 601.1719 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1952.4902 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 87.0117 mm³, the brainstem of volume 755.4199 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 263.6719 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1868.1152 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 611.7188 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1930.0781 mm³."
"Image size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2 of the MRI, showing the head of a man of 37 years old of axial section. Slice n°98 is observed starting from the base of the skull.
