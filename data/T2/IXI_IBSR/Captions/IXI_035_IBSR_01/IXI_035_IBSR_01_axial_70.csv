description
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, of axial section. The observation is made on slice n°70 starting from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1020.4102 mm³, the brainstem of volume 201.7090 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1104.7852 mm³."
