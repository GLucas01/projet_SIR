description
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) size (128, 256, 1) capture representing the head of a man aged  of 37 years old, with a sequence weighted in T2 and sagittal section, starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 428.4668 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4067.1387 mm³ in it."
"MRI size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2, showing the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°188 initiated from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 428.4668 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4067.1387 mm³."
"Magnetic resonance image (MRI) size (128, 256, 1) capturing the head of a man aged  of 37 years old, with a sequence weighted in T2 and sagittal section. The specific slice is number 188, counted from the right hemisphere of the skull. We observe the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 428.4668 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4067.1387 mm³ there."
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of sagittal section. We observe slice n°188 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 428.4668 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4067.1387 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256, 1) in T2, revealing the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°188 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 428.4668 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4067.1387 mm³."
