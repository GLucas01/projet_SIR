description
"MRI size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old of sagittal section. The observation focuses on slice n°84 from the right hemisphere of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2641.9922 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 7040.0391 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 15.8203 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1177.2949 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) of a human head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with sagittal section. We observe slice n°84 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2641.9922 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 7040.0391 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 15.8203 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1177.2949 mm³."
