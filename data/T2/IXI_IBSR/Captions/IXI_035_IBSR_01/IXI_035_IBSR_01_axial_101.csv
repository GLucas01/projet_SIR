description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) in T2, exposing the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°101 beginning from the base of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 497.0215 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2085.6445 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 498.3398 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1828.5645 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 61.9629 mm³, the brainstem of volume 763.3301 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 435.0586 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2101.4648 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 413.9648 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1952.4902 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, of axial section. The observation is made on slice n°101 starting from the base of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 497.0215 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2085.6445 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 498.3398 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1828.5645 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 61.9629 mm³, the brainstem of volume 763.3301 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 435.0586 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2101.4648 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 413.9648 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1952.4902 mm³."
