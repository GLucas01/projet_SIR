description
"Image size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2 of the MRI, showing the head of a man of 37 years old of sagittal section. Slice n°75 is observed starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1632.1289 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5911.5234 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 574.8047 mm³ in it."
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256, 1) in T2 showing the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°75 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1632.1289 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5911.5234 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 574.8047 mm³."

"Magnetic resonance image (MRI) size (128, 256, 1) capturing the head of a man aged  of 37 years old, with a sequence weighted in T2 and sagittal section. The specific slice is number 75, counted from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1632.1289 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5911.5234 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 574.8047 mm³ in it."
