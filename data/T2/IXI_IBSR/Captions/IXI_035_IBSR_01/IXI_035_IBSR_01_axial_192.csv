description
"Visualization in weighting T2 of the MRI size (256, 128, 1), showing the head of a man of 37 years old of axial section. Slice n°192 is observed from the base of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 102.8320 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1469.9707 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 158.2031 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1440.9668 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 128, 1) in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°192 starting from the base of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 102.8320 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1469.9707 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 158.2031 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1440.9668 mm³."
