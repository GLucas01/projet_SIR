description
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in weighted T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°164 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4404.6387 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6292.5293 mm³, the temporal horn of right lateral ventricle of volume 15.8203 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 158.2031 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1473.9258 mm³ and the right hippocampus of volume 60.6445 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with sagittal section. We observe slice n°164 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4404.6387 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6292.5293 mm³, the temporal horn of right lateral ventricle of volume 15.8203 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 158.2031 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1473.9258 mm³ and the right hippocampus of volume 60.6445 mm³."
