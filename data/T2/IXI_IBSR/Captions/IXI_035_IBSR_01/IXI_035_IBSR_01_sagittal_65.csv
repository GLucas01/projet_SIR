description
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2 of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section n°65 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 206.9824 mm³ and the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3904.9805 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256, 1) in T2, revealing the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°65 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 206.9824 mm³ and the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3904.9805 mm³."
