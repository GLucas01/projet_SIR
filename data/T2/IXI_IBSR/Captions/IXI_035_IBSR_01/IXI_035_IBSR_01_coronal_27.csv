description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 256, 1) in T2, exhibiting the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°27 starting from the back of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1649.2676 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4038.1348 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 21.0938 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 307.1777 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 2536.5234 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1580.7129 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3894.4336 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 321.6797 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 2511.4746 mm³."
"MRI size (256, 256, 1) in weighting T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old of coronal section. The observation focuses on slice n°27 from the back of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1649.2676 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4038.1348 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 21.0938 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 307.1777 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 2536.5234 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1580.7129 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3894.4336 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 321.6797 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 2511.4746 mm³."
