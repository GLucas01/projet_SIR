description
"Magnetic resonance image (MRI) size (128, 256, 1) capturing the head of a man aged  of 37 years old, with a sequence weighted in T2 and sagittal section. The specific slice is number 190, counted from the right hemisphere of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 191.1621 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3596.4844 mm³."
