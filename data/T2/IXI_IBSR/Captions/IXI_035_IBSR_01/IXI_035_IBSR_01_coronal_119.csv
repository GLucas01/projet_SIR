description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 256, 1) in T2, exhibiting the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°119 starting from the back of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 221.4844 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 154.2480 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) of a human head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with coronal section. We carefully examine slice n°119 from the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 221.4844 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 154.2480 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (256, 256, 1) with weighting in T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old, in slice coronal n°119 starting from the back of the skull. We see clearly: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 221.4844 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 154.2480 mm³."
