description
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) weighted in T2, revealing the head of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section n°184 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 876.7090 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4987.3535 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 102.8320 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256, 1) weighted in T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section n°184 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 876.7090 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4987.3535 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 102.8320 mm³ in it."
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of sagittal section. We observe slice n°184 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 876.7090 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4987.3535 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 102.8320 mm³."
"Image size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2 of the MRI, showing the head of a man of 37 years old of sagittal section. Slice n°184 is observed starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 876.7090 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4987.3535 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 102.8320 mm³."
