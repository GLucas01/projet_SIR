description
"Image size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2 of the MRI, showing the head of a man of 37 years old of axial section. Slice n°80 is observed starting from the base of the skull. We observe the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 48.7793 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1890.5273 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 9.2285 mm³, the brainstem of volume 292.6758 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 42.1875 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1907.6660 mm³ there."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with axial section. We carefully observe slice n°80 beginning from the base of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 48.7793 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1890.5273 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 9.2285 mm³, the brainstem of volume 292.6758 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 42.1875 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1907.6660 mm³ in it."
