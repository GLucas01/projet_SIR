description
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) weighted in T2, revealing the head of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section n°169 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3430.3711 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6560.1562 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 67.2363 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1288.0371 mm³."
