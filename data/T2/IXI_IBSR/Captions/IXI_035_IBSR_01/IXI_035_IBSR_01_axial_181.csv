description
"Visualization in weighting T2 of the MRI size (256, 128, 1), showing the head of a man of 37 years old of axial section. Slice n°181 is observed from the base of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 974.2676 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3199.6582 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1061.2793 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3149.5605 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size(256, 128, 1) in T2 illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, with axial section n°181 starting from the base of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 974.2676 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3199.6582 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1061.2793 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3149.5605 mm³."
