description
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with axial section. We carefully observe slice n°184 beginning from the base of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 723.7793 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2723.7305 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 767.2852 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2760.6445 mm³."
"MRI representation size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, showing the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°184 initiated from the base of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 723.7793 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2723.7305 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 767.2852 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2760.6445 mm³."

"Illustration size (256, 128, 1) by MRI of the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°184 starting from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 723.7793 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2723.7305 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 767.2852 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2760.6445 mm³."
