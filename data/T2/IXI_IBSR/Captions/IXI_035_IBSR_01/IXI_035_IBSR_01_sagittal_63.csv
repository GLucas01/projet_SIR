"Weighted MRI size (128, 256, 1) in T2, exhibiting the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°63 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 73.8281 mm³ and the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3349.9512 mm³."
