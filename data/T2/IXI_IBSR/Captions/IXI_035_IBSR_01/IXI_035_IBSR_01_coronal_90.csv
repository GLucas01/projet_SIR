description
"MRI size (256, 256, 1) in weighting T2, showing the head of a man of 37 years old, with coronal section n°90 starting from the back of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2130.4688 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2831.8359 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2133.1055 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3220.7520 mm³ in it."
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) of a human head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of coronal section. We observe slice n°90 starting from the back of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2130.4688 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2831.8359 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2133.1055 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3220.7520 mm³."
