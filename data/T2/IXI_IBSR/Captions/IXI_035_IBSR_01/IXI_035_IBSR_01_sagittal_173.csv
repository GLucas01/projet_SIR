description
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256, 1) in weighted T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°173 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2788.3301 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6459.9609 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 5.2734 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1082.3730 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of sagittal section. We observe slice n°173 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2788.3301 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6459.9609 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 5.2734 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1082.3730 mm³."
