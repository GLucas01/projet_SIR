description
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section. The observation is made on slice n°71 from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 991.4062 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5215.4297 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 253.1250 mm³."
