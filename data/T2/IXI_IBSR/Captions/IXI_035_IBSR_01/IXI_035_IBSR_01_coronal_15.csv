description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°15 starting from the back of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1301.2207 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2595.8496 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 2.6367 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1034.9121 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1157.5195 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2490.3809 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1158.8379 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with coronal section. We carefully observe slice n°15 beginning from the back of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1301.2207 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2595.8496 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 2.6367 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1034.9121 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1157.5195 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2490.3809 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1158.8379 mm³."
