description
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2 of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°92 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4920.1172 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5554.2480 mm³, the temporal horn of left lateral ventricle of volume 22.4121 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 162.1582 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1415.9180 mm³ and the left hippocampus of volume 146.3379 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section. The observation is made on slice n°92 from the right hemisphere of the skull.
