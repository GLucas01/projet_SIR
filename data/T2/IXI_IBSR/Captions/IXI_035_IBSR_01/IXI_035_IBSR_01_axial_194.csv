description
"MRI snapshot size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2 describing the skull of a man of age  of 37 years old, of axial section n°194 from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 32.9590 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1007.2266 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 47.4609 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 958.4473 mm³."
"MRI representation size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, showing the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°194 initiated from the base of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 32.9590 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1007.2266 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 47.4609 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 958.4473 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) visualization in T2 of the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°194 starting at the base of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 32.9590 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1007.2266 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 47.4609 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 958.4473 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, of axial section. We observe slice n°194 beginning from the base of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 32.9590 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1007.2266 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 47.4609 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 958.4473 mm³."
