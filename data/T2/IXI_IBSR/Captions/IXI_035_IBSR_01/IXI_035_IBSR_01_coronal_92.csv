description
"MRI snapshot size (256, 256, 1) with weighted imaging in T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old, with coronal section n°92 beginning from the back of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1749.4629 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2895.1172 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1833.8379 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3000.5859 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of coronal section. We observe slice n°92 beginning from the back of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1749.4629 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2895.1172 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1833.8379 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3000.5859 mm³."
