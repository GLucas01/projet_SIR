description
"MRI size (256, 256, 1) in weighting T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section. The observation is made on slice n°100 from the back of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 971.6309 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2676.2695 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1288.0371 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2564.2090 mm³."
