description
"Illustration size (256, 128, 1) by MRI of the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°182 starting from the base of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 893.8477 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3012.4512 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 992.7246 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3020.3613 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, of axial section. The observation is made on slice n°182 starting from the base of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 893.8477 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3012.4512 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 992.7246 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3020.3613 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) visualization in T2 of the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°182 starting at the base of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 893.8477 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3012.4512 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 992.7246 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3020.3613 mm³."
