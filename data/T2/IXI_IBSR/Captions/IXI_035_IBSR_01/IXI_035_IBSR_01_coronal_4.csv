description
"Weighted MRI image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, depicting the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°4 beginning from the back of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 154.2480 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1404.0527 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 168.7500 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 953.1738 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°4 starting from the back of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 154.2480 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1404.0527 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 168.7500 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 953.1738 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°4 starting from the back of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 154.2480 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1404.0527 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 168.7500 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 953.1738 mm³."
"MRI size (256, 256, 1) in weighting T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, with coronal section. The observation is made on slice n°4 from the back of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 154.2480 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1404.0527 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 168.7500 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 953.1738 mm³ there."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, revealing the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°4 beginning from the back of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 154.2480 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1404.0527 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 168.7500 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 953.1738 mm³ in it."
