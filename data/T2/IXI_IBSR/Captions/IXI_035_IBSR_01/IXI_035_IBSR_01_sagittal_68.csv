description
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) of a human head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of sagittal section. We observe slice n°68 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 562.9395 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4332.1289 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1.3184 mm³."
