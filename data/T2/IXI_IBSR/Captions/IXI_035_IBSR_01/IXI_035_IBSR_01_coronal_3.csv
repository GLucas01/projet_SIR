description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 256, 1) in T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, with coronal sectionn°3 beginning at the back of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 47.4609 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 994.0430 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 73.8281 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 808.1543 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°3 starting from the back of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 47.4609 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 994.0430 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 73.8281 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 808.1543 mm³."
"Image in weighting T2 of the MRI size (256, 256, 1), showing the head of a man of 37 years old of coronal section. Slice n°3 is observed from the back of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 47.4609 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 994.0430 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 73.8281 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 808.1543 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with coronal section. We carefully observe slice n°3 beginning from the back of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 47.4609 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 994.0430 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 73.8281 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 808.1543 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, revealing the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°3 beginning from the back of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 47.4609 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 994.0430 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 73.8281 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 808.1543 mm³ in it."
