description
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with coronal section. We carefully observe slice n°8 beginning from the back of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 586.6699 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2189.7949 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 485.1562 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2069.8242 mm³ in it."
