description
"MRI size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, depicting the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°156 starting from the base of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3661.0840 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4181.8359 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3991.9922 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3966.9434 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) visualization in T2 of the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°156 starting at the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3661.0840 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4181.8359 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3991.9922 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3966.9434 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size(256, 128, 1) in T2 illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, with axial section n°156 starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3661.0840 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4181.8359 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3991.9922 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3966.9434 mm³ in it."
