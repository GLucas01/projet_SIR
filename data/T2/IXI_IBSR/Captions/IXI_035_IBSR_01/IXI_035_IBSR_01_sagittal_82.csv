description
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with sagittal section. We observe slice n°82 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2482.4707 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6840.9668 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 1.3184 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1070.5078 mm³ there."
"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in T2, representing the head of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section n°82 beginning from the right hemisphere of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2482.4707 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6840.9668 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 1.3184 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1070.5078 mm³ there."
