description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) in T2, exposing the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°86 beginning from the base of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 379.6875 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 605.1270 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1748.1445 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 13.1836 mm³, the brainstem of volume 477.2461 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 556.3477 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 624.9023 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1731.0059 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, of axial section. We observe slice n°86 beginning from the base of the skull. The section reveals the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 379.6875 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 605.1270 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1748.1445 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 13.1836 mm³, the brainstem of volume 477.2461 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 556.3477 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 624.9023 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1731.0059 mm³."
"Image size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2 of the MRI, showing the head of a man of 37 years old of axial section. Slice n°86 is observed starting from the base of the skull. The following elements are present : the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 379.6875 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 605.1270 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1748.1445 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 13.1836 mm³, the brainstem of volume 477.2461 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 556.3477 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 624.9023 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1731.0059 mm³."
