description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 256, 1) in T2, exposing the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°14 starting from the back of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1190.4785 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2578.7109 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 904.3945 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1161.4746 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2338.7695 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 991.4062 mm³."
