description
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, of axial section. We observe slice n°82 beginning from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6.5918 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 112.0605 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1968.3105 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 7.9102 mm³, the brainstem of volume 307.1777 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 73.8281 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 195.1172 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1887.8906 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size(256, 128, 1) in T2 illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, with axial section n°82 starting from the base of the skull.
