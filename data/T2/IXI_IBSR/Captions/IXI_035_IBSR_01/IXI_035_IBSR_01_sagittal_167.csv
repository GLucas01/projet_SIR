description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256, 1) in T2, revealing the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°167 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3980.1270 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6384.8145 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 81.7383 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1386.9141 mm³."
"MRI size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old of sagittal section. The observation focuses on slice n°167 from the right hemisphere of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3980.1270 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6384.8145 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 81.7383 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1386.9141 mm³."
