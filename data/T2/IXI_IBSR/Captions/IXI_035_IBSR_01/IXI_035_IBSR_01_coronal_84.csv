description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 256, 1) in T2, exhibiting the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°84 starting from the back of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1918.2129 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3804.7852 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 159.5215 mm³, the left caudate nucleus of volume 96.2402 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2065.8691 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3802.1484 mm³, the right lateral ventricle of volume 131.8359 mm³ and the right caudate nucleus of volume 134.4727 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of coronal section. We observe slice n°84 beginning from the back of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1918.2129 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3804.7852 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 159.5215 mm³, the left caudate nucleus of volume 96.2402 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2065.8691 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3802.1484 mm³, the right lateral ventricle of volume 131.8359 mm³ and the right caudate nucleus of volume 134.4727 mm³."
