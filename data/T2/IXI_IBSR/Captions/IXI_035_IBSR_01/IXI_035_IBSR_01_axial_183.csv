description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) in T2, exposing the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°183 beginning from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 831.8848 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2830.5176 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 878.0273 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2876.6602 mm³."
"Illustration size (256, 128, 1) by MRI of the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°183 starting from the base of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 831.8848 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2830.5176 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 878.0273 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2876.6602 mm³."

"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 128, 1) in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°183 starting from the base of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 831.8848 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2830.5176 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 878.0273 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2876.6602 mm³."
"Image size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2 of the MRI, showing the head of a man of 37 years old of axial section. Slice n°183 is observed starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 831.8848 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2830.5176 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 878.0273 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2876.6602 mm³."
