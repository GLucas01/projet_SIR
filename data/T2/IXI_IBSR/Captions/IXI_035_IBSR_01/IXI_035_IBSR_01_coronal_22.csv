description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°22 starting from the back of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1579.3945 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3473.8770 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 13.1836 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 117.3340 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 2085.6445 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1516.1133 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3194.3848 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 163.4766 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 2009.1797 mm³ there."
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) of a human head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with coronal section. We carefully examine slice n°22 from the back of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1579.3945 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3473.8770 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 13.1836 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 117.3340 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 2085.6445 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1516.1133 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3194.3848 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 163.4766 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 2009.1797 mm³."
