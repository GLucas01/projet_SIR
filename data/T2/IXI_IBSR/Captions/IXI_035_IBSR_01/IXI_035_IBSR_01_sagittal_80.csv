description
"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in T2, depicting the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°80 beginning from the right hemisphere of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2448.1934 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6488.9648 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 939.9902 mm³."
