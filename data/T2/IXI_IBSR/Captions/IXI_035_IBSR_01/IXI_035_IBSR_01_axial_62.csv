description
"Illustration size (256, 128, 1) by MRI of the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°62 starting from the base of the skull. The observed details include the left cerebellar cortex of volume 11.8652 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 7.9102 mm³."
"Visualization in weighting T2 of the MRI size (256, 128, 1), showing the head of a man of 37 years old of axial section. Slice n°62 is observed from the base of the skull. The following elements are present : the left cerebellar cortex of volume 11.8652 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 7.9102 mm³."

"Visualization in weighting T2 of the MRI size (256, 128, 1), showing the head of a man of 37 years old of axial section. Slice n°62 is observed from the base of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 11.8652 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 7.9102 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, of axial section. The observation is made on slice n°62 starting from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 11.8652 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 7.9102 mm³."
