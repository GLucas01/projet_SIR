description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 256, 1) in T2 showing the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°2 starting from the back of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6.5918 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 689.5020 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 26.3672 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 748.8281 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) of a human head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of coronal section. We observe slice n°2 starting from the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6.5918 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 689.5020 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 26.3672 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 748.8281 mm³."
