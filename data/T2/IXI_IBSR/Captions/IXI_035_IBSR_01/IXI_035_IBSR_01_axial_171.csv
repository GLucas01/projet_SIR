description
"Visualization in weighting T2 of the MRI size (256, 128, 1), showing the head of a man of 37 years old of axial section. Slice n°171 is observed from the base of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1968.3105 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4007.8125 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2105.4199 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3920.8008 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (256, 128, 1) with weighted imaging in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°171 starting from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1968.3105 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4007.8125 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2105.4199 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3920.8008 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with axial section. We carefully observe slice n°171 beginning from the base of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1968.3105 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4007.8125 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2105.4199 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3920.8008 mm³."
"MRI representation size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, showing the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°171 initiated from the base of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1968.3105 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4007.8125 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2105.4199 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3920.8008 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) visualization in T2 of the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°171 starting at the base of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1968.3105 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4007.8125 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2105.4199 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3920.8008 mm³ there."
