description
"MRI size (256, 256, 1) in weighting T2, showing the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°31 initiated from the back of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1970.9473 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3941.8945 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 40.8691 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 522.0703 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 2652.5391 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1758.6914 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3877.2949 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 482.5195 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 2690.7715 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of coronal section. We observe slice n°31 beginning from the back of the skull.
