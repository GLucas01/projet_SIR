description
"Weighted MRI visualization size (256, 128, 1) in T2 of the skull of a man of 37 years old, with axial section n°90 starting at the base of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 11.8652 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 866.1621 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 781.7871 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1746.8262 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 2.6367 mm³, the brainstem of volume 610.4004 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5.2734 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 976.9043 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 896.4844 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1640.0391 mm³."
"Image size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2 of the MRI, showing the head of a man of 37 years old of axial section. Slice n°90 is observed starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 11.8652 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 866.1621 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 781.7871 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1746.8262 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 2.6367 mm³, the brainstem of volume 610.4004 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5.2734 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 976.9043 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 896.4844 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1640.0391 mm³ in it."
