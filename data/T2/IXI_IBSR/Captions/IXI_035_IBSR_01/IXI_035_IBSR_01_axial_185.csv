description
"Image size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2 of the MRI, showing the head of a man of 37 years old of axial section. Slice n°185 is observed starting from the base of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 627.5391 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2641.9922 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 696.0938 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2598.4863 mm³."

"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 128, 1) in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°185 starting from the base of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 627.5391 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2641.9922 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 696.0938 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2598.4863 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) visualization in T2 of the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°185 starting at the base of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 627.5391 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2641.9922 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 696.0938 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2598.4863 mm³ in it."
