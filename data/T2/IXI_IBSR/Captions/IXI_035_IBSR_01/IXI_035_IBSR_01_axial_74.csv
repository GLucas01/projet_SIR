description
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, of axial section. We observe slice n°74 beginning from the base of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 3.9551 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1468.6523 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 11.8652 mm³, the brainstem of volume 243.8965 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1526.6602 mm³."
"MRI representation size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, showing the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°74 initiated from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 3.9551 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1468.6523 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 11.8652 mm³, the brainstem of volume 243.8965 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1526.6602 mm³."
