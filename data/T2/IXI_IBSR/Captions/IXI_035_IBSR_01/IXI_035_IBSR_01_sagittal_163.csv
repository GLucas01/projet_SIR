description
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) size (128, 256, 1) capture representing the head of a man aged  of 37 years old, with a sequence weighted in T2 and sagittal section, starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4585.2539 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6197.6074 mm³, the temporal horn of right lateral ventricle of volume 10.5469 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 172.7051 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1510.8398 mm³ and the right hippocampus of volume 100.1953 mm³."
"Magnetic resonance image (MRI) size (128, 256, 1) capturing the head of a man aged  of 37 years old, with a sequence weighted in T2 and sagittal section. The specific slice is number 163, counted from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4585.2539 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6197.6074 mm³, the temporal horn of right lateral ventricle of volume 10.5469 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 172.7051 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1510.8398 mm³ and the right hippocampus of volume 100.1953 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) of a human head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with sagittal section. We observe slice n°163 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4585.2539 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6197.6074 mm³, the temporal horn of right lateral ventricle of volume 10.5469 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 172.7051 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1510.8398 mm³ and the right hippocampus of volume 100.1953 mm³ in it."
