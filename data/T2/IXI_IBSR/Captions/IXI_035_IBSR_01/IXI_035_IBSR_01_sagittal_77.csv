description
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256, 1) in T2, exhibiting the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°77 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2077.7344 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6049.9512 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 723.7793 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2 of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section n°77 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2077.7344 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6049.9512 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 723.7793 mm³."
"Magnetic resonance image (MRI) size (128, 256, 1) capturing the head of a man aged  of 37 years old, with a sequence weighted in T2 and sagittal section. The specific slice is number 77, counted from the right hemisphere of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2077.7344 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6049.9512 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 723.7793 mm³."
