description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 256, 1) in T2 showing the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°94 starting from the back of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1585.9863 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2909.6191 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1723.0957 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2895.1172 mm³."
"Image in weighting T2 of the MRI size (256, 256, 1), showing the head of a man of 37 years old of coronal section. Slice n°94 is observed from the back of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1585.9863 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2909.6191 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1723.0957 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2895.1172 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, revealing the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°94 beginning from the back of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1585.9863 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2909.6191 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1723.0957 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2895.1172 mm³."
