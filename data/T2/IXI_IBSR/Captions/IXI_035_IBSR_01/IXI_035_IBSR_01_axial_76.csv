description
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, of axial section. The observation is made on slice n°76 starting from the base of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 32.9590 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1579.3945 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 13.1836 mm³, the brainstem of volume 262.3535 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 3.9551 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1670.3613 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2 describing the skull of a man of age  of 37 years old, of axial section n°76 from the base of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 32.9590 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1579.3945 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 13.1836 mm³, the brainstem of volume 262.3535 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 3.9551 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1670.3613 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with axial section. We carefully observe slice n°76 beginning from the base of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 32.9590 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1579.3945 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 13.1836 mm³, the brainstem of volume 262.3535 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 3.9551 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1670.3613 mm³ in it."
