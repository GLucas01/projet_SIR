description
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) of a human head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of sagittal section. We observe slice n°162 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4955.7129 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5886.4746 mm³, the temporal horn of right lateral ventricle of volume 10.5469 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 181.9336 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1538.5254 mm³ and the right hippocampus of volume 130.5176 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256, 1) in T2, showing the head of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section n°162 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull.
