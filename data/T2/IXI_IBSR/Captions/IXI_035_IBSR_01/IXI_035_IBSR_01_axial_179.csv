description
"MRI snapshot size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2 describing the skull of a man of age  of 37 years old, of axial section n°179 from the base of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1182.5684 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3402.6855 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1121.9238 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3414.5508 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) in T2, exposing the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°179 beginning from the base of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1182.5684 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3402.6855 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1121.9238 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3414.5508 mm³ there."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with axial section. We carefully observe slice n°179 beginning from the base of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1182.5684 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3402.6855 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1121.9238 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3414.5508 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) with weighted imaging in T2, depicting the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°179 beginning from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1182.5684 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3402.6855 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1121.9238 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3414.5508 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, of axial section. The observation is made on slice n°179 starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1182.5684 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3402.6855 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1121.9238 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3414.5508 mm³."
