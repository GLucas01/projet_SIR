description
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of coronal section. We observe slice n°5 starting from the back of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 296.6309 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1591.2598 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 239.9414 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1186.5234 mm³."
"Image in weighting T2 of the MRI size (256, 256, 1), showing the head of a man of 37 years old of coronal section. Slice n°5 is observed from the back of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 296.6309 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1591.2598 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 239.9414 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1186.5234 mm³ in it."

"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, revealing the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°5 beginning from the back of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 296.6309 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1591.2598 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 239.9414 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1186.5234 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with coronal section. We carefully observe slice n°5 beginning from the back of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 296.6309 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1591.2598 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 239.9414 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1186.5234 mm³ there."
