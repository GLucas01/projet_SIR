description
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256, 1) in T2, exhibiting the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°73 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1264.3066 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5635.9863 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 437.6953 mm³ there."
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2 of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°73 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1264.3066 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5635.9863 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 437.6953 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256, 1) weighted in T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section n°73 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1264.3066 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5635.9863 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 437.6953 mm³."

"Weighted MRI size (128, 256, 1) in T2, exhibiting the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°73 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1264.3066 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5635.9863 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 437.6953 mm³."
