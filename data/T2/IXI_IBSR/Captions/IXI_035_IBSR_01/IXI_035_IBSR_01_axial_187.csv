description
"MRI size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, depicting the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°187 starting from the base of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 475.9277 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2370.4102 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 535.2539 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2278.1250 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) with weighted imaging in T2, depicting the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°187 beginning from the base of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 475.9277 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2370.4102 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 535.2539 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2278.1250 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, of axial section. The observation is made on slice n°187 starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 475.9277 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2370.4102 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 535.2539 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2278.1250 mm³ in it."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 128, 1) in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°187 starting from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 475.9277 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2370.4102 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 535.2539 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2278.1250 mm³."
"MRI size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, depicting the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°187 starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 475.9277 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2370.4102 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 535.2539 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2278.1250 mm³."
