description
"Illustration size (256, 128, 1) by MRI of the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°64 starting from the base of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 93.6035 mm³, the brainstem of volume 31.6406 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 155.5664 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) in T2, showing the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°64 starting from the base of the skull. We see clearly: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 93.6035 mm³, the brainstem of volume 31.6406 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 155.5664 mm³."
