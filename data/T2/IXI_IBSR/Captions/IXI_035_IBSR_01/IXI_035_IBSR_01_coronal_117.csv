description
"MRI size (256, 256, 1) in weighting T2, showing the head of a man of 37 years old, with coronal section n°117 starting from the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 697.4121 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 986.1328 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of coronal section. We observe slice n°117 beginning from the back of the skull. We distinguishe the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 697.4121 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 986.1328 mm³ in it."
"Image in weighting T2 of the MRI size (256, 256, 1), showing the head of a man of 37 years old of coronal section. Slice n°117 is observed from the back of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 697.4121 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 986.1328 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with coronal section. We carefully observe slice n°117 beginning from the back of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 697.4121 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 986.1328 mm³."
"MRI size (256, 256, 1) in weighting T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section. The observation is made on slice n°117 from the back of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 697.4121 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 986.1328 mm³."
