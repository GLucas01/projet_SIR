description
"Image size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2 of the MRI, showing the head of a man of 37 years old of axial section. Slice n°200 is observed starting from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2.6367 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2.6367 mm³."
"Illustration size (256, 128, 1) by MRI of the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°200 starting from the base of the skull. The section reveals the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2.6367 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2.6367 mm³."
