description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) visualization in T2 of the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°85 starting at the base of the skull. The observed details include the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 271.5820 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 519.4336 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1770.5566 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 10.5469 mm³, the brainstem of volume 431.1035 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 388.9160 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 590.6250 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1699.3652 mm³."
"Weighted MRI visualization size (256, 128, 1) in T2 of the skull of a man of 37 years old, with axial section n°85 starting at the base of the skull. The following elements are present : the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 271.5820 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 519.4336 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1770.5566 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 10.5469 mm³, the brainstem of volume 431.1035 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 388.9160 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 590.6250 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1699.3652 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) in T2, showing the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°85 starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 271.5820 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 519.4336 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1770.5566 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 10.5469 mm³, the brainstem of volume 431.1035 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 388.9160 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 590.6250 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1699.3652 mm³ in it."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, of axial section. We observe slice n°85 beginning from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 271.5820 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 519.4336 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1770.5566 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 10.5469 mm³, the brainstem of volume 431.1035 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 388.9160 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 590.6250 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1699.3652 mm³."
