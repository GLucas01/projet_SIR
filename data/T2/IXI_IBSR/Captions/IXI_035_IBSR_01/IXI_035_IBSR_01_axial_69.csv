description
"MRI size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, depicting the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°69 starting from the base of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 870.1172 mm³, the brainstem of volume 183.2520 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 943.9453 mm³."
