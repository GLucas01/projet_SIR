description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 256, 1) in T2, exhibiting the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°85 starting from the back of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1989.4043 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3749.4141 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 164.7949 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2105.4199 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3749.4141 mm³, the right lateral ventricle of volume 122.6074 mm³ and the right caudate nucleus of volume 80.4199 mm³."
"Image in weighting T2 of the MRI size (256, 256, 1), showing the head of a man of 37 years old of coronal section. Slice n°85 is observed from the back of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1989.4043 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3749.4141 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 164.7949 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2105.4199 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3749.4141 mm³, the right lateral ventricle of volume 122.6074 mm³ and the right caudate nucleus of volume 80.4199 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°85 starting from the back of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1989.4043 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3749.4141 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 164.7949 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2105.4199 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3749.4141 mm³, the right lateral ventricle of volume 122.6074 mm³ and the right caudate nucleus of volume 80.4199 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°85 starting from the back of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1989.4043 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3749.4141 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 164.7949 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2105.4199 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3749.4141 mm³, the right lateral ventricle of volume 122.6074 mm³ and the right caudate nucleus of volume 80.4199 mm³."
