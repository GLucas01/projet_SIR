description
"MRI snapshot size (256, 128, 1) with weighted imaging in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°186 starting from the base of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 539.2090 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2523.3398 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 619.6289 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2448.1934 mm³."
