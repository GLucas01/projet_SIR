description
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with axial section. We observe slice n°197 beginning from the base of the skull. The section reveals the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 251.8066 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 309.8145 mm³."
