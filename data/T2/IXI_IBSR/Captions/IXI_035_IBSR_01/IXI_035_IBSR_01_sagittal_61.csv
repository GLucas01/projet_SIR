"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2 of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°61 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 10.5469 mm³ and the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2519.3848 mm³."
