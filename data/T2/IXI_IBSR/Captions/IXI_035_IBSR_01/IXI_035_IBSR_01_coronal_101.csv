description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, revealing the head of a man of 37 years old, with coronal section n°101 initiated from the back of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 907.0312 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2630.1270 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1303.8574 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2467.9688 mm³."
"MRI size (256, 256, 1) in weighting T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section. The observation is made on slice n°101 from the back of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 907.0312 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2630.1270 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1303.8574 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2467.9688 mm³."
