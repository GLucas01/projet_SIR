description
"Illustration size (256, 128, 1) by MRI of the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°195 starting from the base of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 13.1836 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 764.6484 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 17.1387 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 756.7383 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) in T2, exposing the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°195 beginning from the base of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 13.1836 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 764.6484 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 17.1387 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 756.7383 mm³."
