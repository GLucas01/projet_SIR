description
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of coronal section. We observe slice n°93 beginning from the back of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1643.9941 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2932.0312 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1833.8379 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2881.9336 mm³."
