description
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256, 1) in T2, showing the head of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section n°89 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3889.1602 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6378.2227 mm³, the temporal horn of left lateral ventricle of volume 1.3184 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 112.0605 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1322.3145 mm³ and the left hippocampus of volume 34.2773 mm³."
