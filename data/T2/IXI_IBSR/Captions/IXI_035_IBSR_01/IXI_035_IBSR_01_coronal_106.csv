description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, revealing the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°106 beginning from the back of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 602.4902 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2255.7129 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 688.1836 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2421.8262 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with coronal section. We carefully observe slice n°106 beginning from the back of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 602.4902 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2255.7129 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 688.1836 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2421.8262 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (256, 256, 1) with weighted imaging in T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old, with coronal section n°106 beginning from the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 602.4902 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2255.7129 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 688.1836 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2421.8262 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 256, 1) in T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, with coronal sectionn°106 beginning at the back of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 602.4902 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2255.7129 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 688.1836 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2421.8262 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) of a human head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with coronal section. We carefully examine slice n°106 from the back of the skull.
