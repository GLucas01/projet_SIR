description
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, of axial section. We observe slice n°93 beginning from the base of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 35.5957 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1111.3770 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 875.3906 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1716.5039 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 17.1387 mm³, the brainstem of volume 677.6367 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 31.6406 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1170.7031 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 879.3457 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1765.2832 mm³ there."

"MRI size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old of axial section. The observation focuses on slice n°93 starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 35.5957 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1111.3770 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 875.3906 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1716.5039 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 17.1387 mm³, the brainstem of volume 677.6367 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 31.6406 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1170.7031 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 879.3457 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1765.2832 mm³."
