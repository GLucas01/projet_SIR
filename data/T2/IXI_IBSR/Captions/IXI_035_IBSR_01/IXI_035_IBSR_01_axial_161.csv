description
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with axial section. We carefully observe slice n°161 beginning from the base of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2785.6934 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4552.2949 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2810.7422 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4635.3516 mm³."
"MRI size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old of axial section. The observation focuses on slice n°161 starting from the base of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2785.6934 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4552.2949 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2810.7422 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4635.3516 mm³."
