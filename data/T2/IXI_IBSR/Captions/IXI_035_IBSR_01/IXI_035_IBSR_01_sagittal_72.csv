description
"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in T2, depicting the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°72 beginning from the right hemisphere of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1131.1523 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5436.9141 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 365.1855 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) of a human head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of sagittal section. We observe slice n°72 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1131.1523 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5436.9141 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 365.1855 mm³."
