description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) visualization in T2 of the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°68 starting at the base of the skull. The section reveals the left cerebellar cortex of volume 715.8691 mm³, the brainstem of volume 125.2441 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 726.4160 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with axial section. We carefully observe slice n°68 beginning from the base of the skull. We see the left cerebellar cortex of volume 715.8691 mm³, the brainstem of volume 125.2441 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 726.4160 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (256, 128, 1) with weighted imaging in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°68 starting from the base of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 715.8691 mm³, the brainstem of volume 125.2441 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 726.4160 mm³."
"MRI size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2, depicting the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°68 starting from the base of the skull. We see clearly: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 715.8691 mm³, the brainstem of volume 125.2441 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 726.4160 mm³."
