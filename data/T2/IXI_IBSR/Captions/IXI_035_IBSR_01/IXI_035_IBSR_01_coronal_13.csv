description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 256, 1) in T2, exhibiting the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°13 starting from the back of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1125.8789 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2541.7969 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 663.1348 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 991.4062 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2374.3652 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 830.5664 mm³ there."
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with coronal section. We observe slice n°13 starting at the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1125.8789 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2541.7969 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 663.1348 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 991.4062 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2374.3652 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 830.5664 mm³."
