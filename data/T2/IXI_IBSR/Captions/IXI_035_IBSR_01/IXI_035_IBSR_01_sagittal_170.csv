description
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256, 1) weighted in T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section n°170 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3249.7559 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6587.8418 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 42.1875 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1243.2129 mm³."
"Magnetic resonance image (MRI) size (128, 256, 1) capturing the head of a man aged  of 37 years old, with a sequence weighted in T2 and sagittal section. The specific slice is number 170, counted from the right hemisphere of the skull. We observe the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3249.7559 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6587.8418 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 42.1875 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1243.2129 mm³ there."
