description
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with sagittal section. We observe slice n°189 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 321.6797 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3788.9648 mm³."
