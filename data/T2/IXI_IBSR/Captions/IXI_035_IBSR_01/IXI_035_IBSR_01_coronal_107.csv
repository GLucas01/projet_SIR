description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 256, 1) in T2, exposing the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°107 starting from the back of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 527.3438 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2129.1504 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 622.2656 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2366.4551 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, revealing the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°107 beginning from the back of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 527.3438 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2129.1504 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 622.2656 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2366.4551 mm³ there."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°107 starting from the back of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 527.3438 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2129.1504 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 622.2656 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2366.4551 mm³ in it."
