description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°9 starting from the back of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 783.1055 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2230.6641 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 688.1836 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2014.4531 mm³."
"MRI size (256, 256, 1) in weighting T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old of coronal section. The observation focuses on slice n°9 from the back of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 783.1055 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2230.6641 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 688.1836 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2014.4531 mm³."
