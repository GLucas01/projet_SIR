description
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with axial section. We observe slice n°191 beginning from the base of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 172.7051 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1637.4023 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 216.2109 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1633.4473 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with axial section. We carefully observe slice n°191 beginning from the base of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 172.7051 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1637.4023 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 216.2109 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1633.4473 mm³."
