description
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) size (128, 256, 1) capture representing the head of a man aged  of 37 years old, with a sequence weighted in T2 and sagittal section, starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The following elements are present : the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2672.3145 mm³."
"MRI size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2, showing the head of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section n°193 initiated from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see clearly: the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2672.3145 mm³."
"Magnetic resonance image (MRI) size (128, 256, 1) capturing the head of a man aged  of 37 years old, with a sequence weighted in T2 and sagittal section. The specific slice is number 193, counted from the right hemisphere of the skull. We observe the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2672.3145 mm³ there."
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with sagittal section. We observe slice n°193 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2672.3145 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256, 1) in weighted T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°193 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2672.3145 mm³."
