description
"Weighted MRI image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, representing the head of a man of 37 years old, with coronal section n°116 starting at the back of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 47.4609 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 883.3008 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 29.0039 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1161.4746 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 256, 1) in T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, with coronal sectionn°116 beginning at the back of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 47.4609 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 883.3008 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 29.0039 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1161.4746 mm³."
"Image in weighting T2 of the MRI size (256, 256, 1), showing the head of a man of 37 years old of coronal section. Slice n°116 is observed from the back of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 47.4609 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 883.3008 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 29.0039 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1161.4746 mm³ in it."
