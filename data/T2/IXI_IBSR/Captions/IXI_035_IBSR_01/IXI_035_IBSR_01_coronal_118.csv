description
"MRI size (256, 256, 1) in weighting T2, showing the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°118 initiated from the back of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 416.6016 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 657.8613 mm³."
"Weighted MRI image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, depicting the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°118 beginning from the back of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 416.6016 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 657.8613 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, revealing the head of a man of 37 years old, with coronal section n°118 initiated from the back of the skull. We see clearly: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 416.6016 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 657.8613 mm³."
"Weighted MRI image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, representing the head of a man of 37 years old, with coronal section n°118 starting at the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 416.6016 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 657.8613 mm³."
"Image in weighting T2 of the MRI size (256, 256, 1), showing the head of a man of 37 years old of coronal section. Slice n°118 is observed from the back of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 416.6016 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 657.8613 mm³."
