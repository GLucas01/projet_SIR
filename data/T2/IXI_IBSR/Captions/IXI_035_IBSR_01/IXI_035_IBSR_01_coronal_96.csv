description
"Weighted MRI image size (256, 256, 1) in T2, depicting the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°96 beginning from the back of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1446.2402 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2788.3301 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1502.9297 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2918.8477 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) of a human head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of coronal section. We observe slice n°96 starting from the back of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1446.2402 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2788.3301 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1502.9297 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2918.8477 mm³."
