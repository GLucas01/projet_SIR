description
"MRI size (256, 256, 1) in weighting T2, showing the head of a man of 37 years old, with coronal section n°110 starting from the back of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 570.8496 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1448.8770 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 682.9102 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1756.0547 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (256, 256, 1) with weighting in T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old, in slice coronal n°110 starting from the back of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 570.8496 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1448.8770 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 682.9102 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1756.0547 mm³."
"MRI size (256, 256, 1) in weighting T2, showing the head of a man of 37 years old, with coronal section n°110 starting from the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 570.8496 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1448.8770 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 682.9102 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1756.0547 mm³."
