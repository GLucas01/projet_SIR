description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) visualization in T2 of the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°83 starting at the base of the skull. The observed details include the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 55.3711 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 222.8027 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1919.5312 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 6.5918 mm³, the brainstem of volume 328.2715 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 160.8398 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 297.9492 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1853.6133 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with axial section. We observe slice n°83 beginning from the base of the skull. The observed details include the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 55.3711 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 222.8027 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1919.5312 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 6.5918 mm³, the brainstem of volume 328.2715 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 160.8398 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 297.9492 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1853.6133 mm³."
