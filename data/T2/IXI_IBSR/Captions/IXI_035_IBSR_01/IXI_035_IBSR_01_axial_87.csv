description
"Illustration size (256, 128, 1) by MRI of the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°87 starting from the base of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 514.1602 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 655.2246 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1765.2832 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 13.1836 mm³, the brainstem of volume 524.7070 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 684.2285 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 660.4980 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1756.0547 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) in T2, exposing the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°87 beginning from the base of the skull. The observed details include the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 514.1602 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 655.2246 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1765.2832 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 13.1836 mm³, the brainstem of volume 524.7070 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 684.2285 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 660.4980 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1756.0547 mm³."
