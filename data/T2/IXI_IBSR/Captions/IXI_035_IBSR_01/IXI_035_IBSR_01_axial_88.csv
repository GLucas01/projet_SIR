description
"Weighted MRI visualization size (256, 128, 1) in T2 of the skull of a man of 37 years old, with axial section n°88 starting at the base of the skull. The following elements are present : the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 642.0410 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 651.2695 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1803.5156 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 11.8652 mm³, the brainstem of volume 549.7559 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 808.1543 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 710.5957 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1763.9648 mm³."
"Image size (256, 128, 1) with weighting in T2 of the MRI, showing the head of a man of 37 years old of axial section. Slice n°88 is observed starting from the base of the skull. The observed details include: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 642.0410 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 651.2695 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1803.5156 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 11.8652 mm³, the brainstem of volume 549.7559 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 808.1543 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 710.5957 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1763.9648 mm³."
