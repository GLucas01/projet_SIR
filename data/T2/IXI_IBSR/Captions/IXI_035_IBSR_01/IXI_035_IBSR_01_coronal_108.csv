description
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) of a human head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of coronal section. We observe slice n°108 starting from the back of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 609.0820 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1915.5762 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 743.5547 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2105.4199 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with coronal section. We carefully observe slice n°108 beginning from the back of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 609.0820 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1915.5762 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 743.5547 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2105.4199 mm³ there."
