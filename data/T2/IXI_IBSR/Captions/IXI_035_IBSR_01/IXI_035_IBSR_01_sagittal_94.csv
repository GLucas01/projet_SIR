description
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) weighted in T2, revealing the head of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section n°94 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5074.3652 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5443.5059 mm³, the temporal horn of left lateral ventricle of volume 10.5469 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 218.8477 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1442.2852 mm³, the left putamen of volume 18.4570 mm³ and the left hippocampus of volume 199.0723 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2, presenting the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section. The observation is made on slice n°94 from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5074.3652 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5443.5059 mm³, the temporal horn of left lateral ventricle of volume 10.5469 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 218.8477 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1442.2852 mm³, the left putamen of volume 18.4570 mm³ and the left hippocampus of volume 199.0723 mm³."
