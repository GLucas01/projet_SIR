description
"MRI snapshot size (256, 256, 1) with weighted imaging in T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old, with coronal section n°111 beginning from the back of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 502.2949 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1348.6816 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 611.7188 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1626.8555 mm³."
