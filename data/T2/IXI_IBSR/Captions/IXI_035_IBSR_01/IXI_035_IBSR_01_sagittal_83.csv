description
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2 of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°83 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2595.8496 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6924.0234 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 2.6367 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1136.4258 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with sagittal section. We observe slice n°83 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2595.8496 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6924.0234 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 2.6367 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1136.4258 mm³ in it."
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) size (128, 256, 1) capture representing the head of a man aged  of 37 years old, with a sequence weighted in T2 and sagittal section, starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2595.8496 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6924.0234 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 2.6367 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1136.4258 mm³."
"Magnetic resonance image (MRI) size (128, 256, 1) capturing the head of a man aged  of 37 years old, with a sequence weighted in T2 and sagittal section. The specific slice is number 83, counted from the right hemisphere of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2595.8496 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6924.0234 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 2.6367 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1136.4258 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) weighted in T2, revealing the head of a man of 37 years old, with sagittal section n°83 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2595.8496 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6924.0234 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 2.6367 mm³ and the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1136.4258 mm³."
