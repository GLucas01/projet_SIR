description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) in T2, showing the skull of a person a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°91 starting from the base of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 17.1387 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 955.8105 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 839.7949 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1708.5938 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 2.6367 mm³, the brainstem of volume 639.4043 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 9.2285 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1037.5488 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 934.7168 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1646.6309 mm³."
"Illustration size (256, 128, 1) by MRI of the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°91 starting from the base of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 17.1387 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 955.8105 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 839.7949 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1708.5938 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 2.6367 mm³, the brainstem of volume 639.4043 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 9.2285 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1037.5488 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 934.7168 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1646.6309 mm³."

The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 17.1387 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 955.8105 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 839.7949 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1708.5938 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 2.6367 mm³, the brainstem of volume 639.4043 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 9.2285 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1037.5488 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 934.7168 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1646.6309 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 128, 1) in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°91 starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 17.1387 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 955.8105 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 839.7949 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1708.5938 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 2.6367 mm³, the brainstem of volume 639.4043 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 9.2285 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1037.5488 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 934.7168 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1646.6309 mm³."
