description
"Image size (128, 256, 1) in weighting T2 of the MRI, showing the head of a man of 37 years old of sagittal section. Slice n°93 is observed starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5034.8145 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5463.2812 mm³, the temporal horn of left lateral ventricle of volume 11.8652 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 193.7988 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1430.4199 mm³ and the left hippocampus of volume 185.8887 mm³."

"Weighted MRI size (128, 256, 1) in T2, exhibiting the head of a man of 37 years old, of sagittal section n°93 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5034.8145 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5463.2812 mm³, the temporal horn of left lateral ventricle of volume 11.8652 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 193.7988 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1430.4199 mm³ and the left hippocampus of volume 185.8887 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256, 1) of a human head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, with sagittal section. We observe slice n°93 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5034.8145 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5463.2812 mm³, the temporal horn of left lateral ventricle of volume 11.8652 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 193.7988 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1430.4199 mm³ and the left hippocampus of volume 185.8887 mm³."
