description
"MRI snapshot size (256, 256, 1) with weighting in T2, illustrating the head of a man of 37 years old, in slice coronal n°11 starting from the back of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 974.2676 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2341.4062 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 300.5859 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 796.2891 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2258.3496 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 437.6953 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256, 1) of a human head of a man of 37 years old in weighting T2, of coronal section. We observe slice n°11 starting from the back of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 974.2676 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2341.4062 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 300.5859 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 796.2891 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2258.3496 mm³ and the right cerebellar cortex of volume 437.6953 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 256, 1) in T2, exhibiting the head of a man of 37 years old, of coronal section n°11 starting from the back of the skull.
