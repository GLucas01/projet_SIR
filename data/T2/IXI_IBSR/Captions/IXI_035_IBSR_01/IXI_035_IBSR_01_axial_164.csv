description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 128, 1) visualization in T2 of the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°164 starting at the base of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2400.7324 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4570.7520 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2320.3125 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4622.1680 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (256, 128, 1) with weighted imaging in T2, illustrating the skull of a man of 37 years old, of axial section n°164 starting from the base of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2400.7324 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4570.7520 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2320.3125 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4622.1680 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 128, 1) of the head of a man of 37 years old with weighting in T2, of axial section. We observe slice n°164 beginning from the base of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2400.7324 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4570.7520 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2320.3125 mm³ and the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4622.1680 mm³."
