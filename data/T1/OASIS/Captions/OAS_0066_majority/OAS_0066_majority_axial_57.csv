description
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1, showing the skull of a person a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°57 starting from the base of the skull. The observed details include the left cerebellar cortex of volume 765.0000 mm³, the brainstem of volume 192.5000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 718.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 86.2500 mm³."
"MRI size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old of axial section. The observation focuses on slice n°57 starting from the base of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 765.0000 mm³, the brainstem of volume 192.5000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 718.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 86.2500 mm³."

"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1, exposing the skull of a person a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°57 beginning from the base of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 765.0000 mm³, the brainstem of volume 192.5000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 718.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 86.2500 mm³."
"Illustration size (128, 256) by MRI of the head of a woman of 66 years old with weighting in T1, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°57 starting from the base of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the left cerebellar cortex of volume 765.0000 mm³, the brainstem of volume 192.5000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 718.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 86.2500 mm³."
