description
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with axial section. We carefully observe slice n°133 beginning from the base of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1206.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4007.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1288.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3871.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 515.0000 mm³."
"MRI size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old of axial section. The observation focuses on slice n°133 starting from the base of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1206.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4007.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1288.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3871.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 515.0000 mm³."
