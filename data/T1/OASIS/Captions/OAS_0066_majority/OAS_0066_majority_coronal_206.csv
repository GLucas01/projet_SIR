description
"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256) in T1, representing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°206 starting at the back of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 473.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1457.5000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 666.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 290.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1085.0000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 357.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 286.2500 mm³ there."
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with coronal section. We carefully observe slice n°206 beginning from the back of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 473.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1457.5000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 666.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 290.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1085.0000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 357.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 286.2500 mm³."
