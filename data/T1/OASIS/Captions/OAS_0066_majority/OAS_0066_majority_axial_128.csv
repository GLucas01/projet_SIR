description
"Image size (128, 256) with weighting in T1 of the MRI, showing the head of a woman of 66 years old of axial section. Slice n°128 is observed starting from the base of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1956.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3953.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1945.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3935.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 603.7500 mm³."
