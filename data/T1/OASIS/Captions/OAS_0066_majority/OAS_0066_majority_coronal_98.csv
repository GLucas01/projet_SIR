description
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with coronal section. We carefully observe slice n°98 beginning from the back of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 781.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1561.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 985.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1667.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 200.0000 mm³."
