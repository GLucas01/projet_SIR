description
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1 showing the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°93 starting from the back of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 612.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1453.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 807.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1673.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 165.0000 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old, in slice coronal n°93 starting from the back of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 612.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1453.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 807.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1673.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 165.0000 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, revealing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°93 initiated from the back of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 612.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1453.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 807.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1673.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 165.0000 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256) with weighted imaging in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°93 beginning from the back of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 612.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1453.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 807.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1673.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 165.0000 mm³ there."
"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256) in T1, depicting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°93 beginning from the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 612.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1453.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 807.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1673.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 165.0000 mm³."
