description
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1, showing the skull of a person a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°130 starting from the base of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1616.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4027.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1676.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3985.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 523.7500 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with axial section. We observe slice n°130 beginning from the base of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1616.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4027.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1676.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3985.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 523.7500 mm³."
