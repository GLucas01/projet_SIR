description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, revealing the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°72 beginning from the back of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 26.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 621.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 80.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1046.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 81.2500 mm³."
"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256) in T1, representing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°72 starting at the back of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 26.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 621.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 80.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1046.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 81.2500 mm³."

"MRI image size (128, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with coronal section. We observe slice n°72 starting at the back of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 26.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 621.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 80.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1046.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 81.2500 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) of a human head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, of coronal section. We observe slice n°72 starting from the back of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 26.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 621.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 80.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1046.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 81.2500 mm³."
