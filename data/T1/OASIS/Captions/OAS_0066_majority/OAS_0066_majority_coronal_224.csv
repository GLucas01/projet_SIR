"MRI snapshot size (128, 256) with weighted imaging in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°224 beginning from the back of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 61.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 17.5000 mm³."
