description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, revealing the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°106 beginning from the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1026.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1602.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1116.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1900.0000 mm³, the right lateral ventricle of volume 27.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 273.7500 mm³."
"Image in weighting T1 of the MRI size (128, 256), showing the head of a woman of 66 years old of coronal section. Slice n°106 is observed from the back of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1026.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1602.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1116.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1900.0000 mm³, the right lateral ventricle of volume 27.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 273.7500 mm³ there."
