description
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with axial section. We carefully observe slice n°141 beginning from the base of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 665.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2952.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 658.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3148.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 420.0000 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1, showing the skull of a person a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°141 starting from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 665.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2952.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 658.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3148.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 420.0000 mm³."

"Visualization in weighting T1 of the MRI size (128, 256), showing the head of a woman of 66 years old of axial section. Slice n°141 is observed from the base of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 665.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2952.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 658.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3148.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 420.0000 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size(128, 256) in T1 illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, with axial section n°141 starting from the base of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 665.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2952.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 658.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3148.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 420.0000 mm³."
