description
"MRI image size (128, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old with weighting in T1, of axial section. We observe slice n°154 beginning from the base of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 763.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 791.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 118.7500 mm³."
