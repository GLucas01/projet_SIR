description
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old with weighting in T1, of axial section n°120. We observe slice n°120 starting from the base of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3308.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3475.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3265.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3475.0000 mm³, the right lateral ventricle of volume 10.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 590.0000 mm³ there."
