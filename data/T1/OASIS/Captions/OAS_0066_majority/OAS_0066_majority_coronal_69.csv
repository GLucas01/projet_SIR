description
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with coronal section. We carefully observe slice n°69 beginning from the back of the skull. We observe the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 347.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 7.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 807.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 71.2500 mm³ there."
