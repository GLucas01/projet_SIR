description
"MRI image size (128, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, of coronal section. We observe slice n°221 beginning from the back of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 463.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 71.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 38.7500 mm³."
