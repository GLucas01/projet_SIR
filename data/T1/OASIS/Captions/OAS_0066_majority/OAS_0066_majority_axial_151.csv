description
"Illustration size (128, 256) by MRI of the head of a woman of 66 years old with weighting in T1, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°151 starting from the base of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1476.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1528.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 146.2500 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, presenting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section. The observation is made on slice n°151 starting from the base of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1476.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1528.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 146.2500 mm³."
