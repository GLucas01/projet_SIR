description
"Weighted MRI size(128, 256) in T1 illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, with axial section n°126 starting from the base of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2261.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3830.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2457.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3653.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 672.5000 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) visualization in T1 of the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°126 starting at the base of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2261.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3830.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2457.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3653.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 672.5000 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old with weighting in T1, of axial section. We observe slice n°126 beginning from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2261.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3830.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2457.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3653.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 672.5000 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°126 starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2261.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3830.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2457.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3653.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 672.5000 mm³."
"MRI representation size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, showing the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°126 initiated from the base of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2261.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3830.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2457.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3653.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 672.5000 mm³."
