description
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1, exhibiting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°218 starting from the back of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 777.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 358.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 45.0000 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256) with weighted imaging in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°218 beginning from the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 777.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 358.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 45.0000 mm³."

"MRI image size (128, 256) of a human head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with coronal section. We carefully examine slice n°218 from the back of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 777.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 358.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 45.0000 mm³."
