description
"MRI size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, depicting the skull of a person a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°156 starting from the base of the skull. We observe the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 290.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 321.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 92.5000 mm³ there."
"MRI image size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, describing the skull of a woman of age  of 66 years old, of axial section n°156 from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 290.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 321.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 92.5000 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with axial section. We observe slice n°156 beginning from the base of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 290.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 321.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 92.5000 mm³."
"MRI representation size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, showing the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°156 initiated from the base of the skull. We observe the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 290.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 321.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 92.5000 mm³ there."
