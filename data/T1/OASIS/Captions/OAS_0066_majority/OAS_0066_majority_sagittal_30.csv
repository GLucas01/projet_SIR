description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 256) in T1, showing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with sagittal section n°30 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2085.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5858.7500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1117.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 623.7500 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (256, 256) in weighted T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old, of sagittal section n°30 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2085.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5858.7500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1117.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 623.7500 mm³."
