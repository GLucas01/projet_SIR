description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°76 starting from the back of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 140.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 857.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 256.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1203.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 97.5000 mm³."
"MRI size (128, 256) in weighting T1, presenting the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section. The observation is made on slice n°76 from the back of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 140.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 857.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 256.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1203.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 97.5000 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with coronal section. We carefully observe slice n°76 beginning from the back of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 140.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 857.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 256.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1203.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 97.5000 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256) with weighted imaging in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°76 beginning from the back of the skull.
