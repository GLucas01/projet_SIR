description
"MRI image size (128, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with coronal section. We observe slice n°99 starting at the back of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 828.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1548.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1015.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1677.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 220.0000 mm³."
