description
"MRI size (128, 256) in weighting T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old of coronal section. The observation focuses on slice n°90 from the back of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 526.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1367.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 718.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1591.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 178.7500 mm³."
"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256) in T1, depicting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°90 beginning from the back of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 526.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1367.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 718.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1591.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 178.7500 mm³."
"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256) in T1, representing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°90 starting at the back of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 526.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1367.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 718.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1591.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 178.7500 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1, presenting the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal sectionn°90 beginning at the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 526.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1367.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 718.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1591.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 178.7500 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) of a human head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with coronal section. We carefully examine slice n°90 from the back of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 526.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1367.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 718.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1591.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 178.7500 mm³."
