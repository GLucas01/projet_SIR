description
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old with weighting in T1, of axial section n°56. We observe slice n°56 starting from the base of the skull. The observed details include: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 597.5000 mm³, the brainstem of volume 172.5000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 532.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 137.5000 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size(128, 256) in T1 illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, with axial section n°56 starting from the base of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the left cerebellar cortex of volume 597.5000 mm³, the brainstem of volume 172.5000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 532.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 137.5000 mm³."
"Image size (128, 256) with weighting in T1 of the MRI, showing the head of a woman of 66 years old of axial section. Slice n°56 is observed starting from the base of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 597.5000 mm³, the brainstem of volume 172.5000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 532.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 137.5000 mm³."

"Illustration size (128, 256) by MRI of the head of a woman of 66 years old with weighting in T1, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°56 starting from the base of the skull. The section reveals the left cerebellar cortex of volume 597.5000 mm³, the brainstem of volume 172.5000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 532.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 137.5000 mm³."
