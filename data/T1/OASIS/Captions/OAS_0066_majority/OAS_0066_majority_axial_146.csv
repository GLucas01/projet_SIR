description
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old with weighting in T1, of axial section n°146. We observe slice n°146 starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 191.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2487.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 180.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2531.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 276.2500 mm³ in it."
"Weighted MRI visualization size (128, 256) in T1 of the skull of a woman of 66 years old, with axial section n°146 starting at the base of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 191.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2487.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 180.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2531.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 276.2500 mm³."
