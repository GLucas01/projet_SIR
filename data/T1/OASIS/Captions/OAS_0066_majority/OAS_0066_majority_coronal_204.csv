"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with coronal section. We carefully observe slice n°204 beginning from the back of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 596.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1442.5000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 798.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 413.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1091.2500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 481.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 287.5000 mm³ there."
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1, exhibiting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°204 starting from the back of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 596.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1442.5000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 798.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 413.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1091.2500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 481.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 287.5000 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, revealing the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°204 beginning from the back of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 596.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1442.5000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 798.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 413.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1091.2500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 481.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 287.5000 mm³."
