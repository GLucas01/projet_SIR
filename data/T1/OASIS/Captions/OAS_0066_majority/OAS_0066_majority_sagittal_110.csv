description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 256) in T1, exhibiting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of sagittal section n°110 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The section reveals the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2585.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 111.2500 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with sagittal section. We observe slice n°110 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The observed details include the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2585.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 111.2500 mm³."
