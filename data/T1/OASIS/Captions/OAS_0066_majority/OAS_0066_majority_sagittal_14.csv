"MRI image size (256, 256) in weighted T1, illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of sagittal section n°14 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The observed details include the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1386.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 78.7500 mm³."
"Magnetic resonance image (MRI) size (256, 256) capturing the head of a woman aged  of 66 years old, with a sequence weighted in T1 and sagittal section. The specific slice is number 14, counted from the right hemisphere of the skull. The observed details include: the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1386.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 78.7500 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 256) in T1, exhibiting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of sagittal section n°14 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1386.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 78.7500 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256) of a human head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with sagittal section. We observe slice n°14 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1386.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 78.7500 mm³ in it."
