description
"MRI image size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, presenting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section. The observation is made on slice n°149 starting from the base of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 37.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1958.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 40.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1930.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 211.2500 mm³."
"MRI representation size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, showing the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°149 initiated from the base of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 37.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1958.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 40.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1930.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 211.2500 mm³."
