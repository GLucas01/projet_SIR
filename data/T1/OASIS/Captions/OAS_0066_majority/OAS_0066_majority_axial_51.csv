"MRI size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old of axial section. The observation focuses on slice n°51 starting from the base of the skull. We see clearly: the brainstem of volume 15.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 12.5000 mm³."
"Illustration size (128, 256) by MRI of the head of a woman of 66 years old with weighting in T1, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°51 starting from the base of the skull. We observe the brainstem of volume 15.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 12.5000 mm³ there."
