description
"MRI size (128, 256) in weighting T1, presenting the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section. The observation is made on slice n°186 from the back of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 857.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2217.5000 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 250.0000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1297.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 676.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1851.2500 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 167.5000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1227.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 428.7500 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°186 starting from the back of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 857.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2217.5000 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 250.0000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1297.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 676.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1851.2500 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 167.5000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1227.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 428.7500 mm³."
