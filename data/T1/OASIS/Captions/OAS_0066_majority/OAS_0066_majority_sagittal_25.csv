description
"Magnetic resonance image (MRI) size (256, 256) capturing the head of a woman aged  of 66 years old, with a sequence weighted in T1 and sagittal section. The specific slice is number 25, counted from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 903.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5312.5000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 718.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 457.5000 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256) in weighted T1, illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of sagittal section n°25 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 903.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5312.5000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 718.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 457.5000 mm³."
