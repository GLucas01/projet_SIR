"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1, exposing the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°68 starting from the back of the skull. The observed details include: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 231.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 676.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 61.2500 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1, exposing the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°68 starting from the back of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 231.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 676.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 61.2500 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with coronal section. We observe slice n°68 starting at the back of the skull. The observed details include the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 231.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 676.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 61.2500 mm³."
"Image in weighting T1 of the MRI size (128, 256), showing the head of a woman of 66 years old of coronal section. Slice n°68 is observed from the back of the skull. We distinguishe the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 231.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 676.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 61.2500 mm³ in it."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, revealing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°68 initiated from the back of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 231.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 676.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 61.2500 mm³."
