description
"MRI size (256, 256) in weighting T1, showing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with sagittal section n°33 initiated from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3175.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5882.5000 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 18.7500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1287.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 461.2500 mm³."
