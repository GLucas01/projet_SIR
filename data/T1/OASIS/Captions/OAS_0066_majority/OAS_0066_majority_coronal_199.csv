description
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, of coronal section. We observe slice n°199 starting from the back of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 637.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1700.0000 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 1.2500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1100.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 533.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1273.7500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 806.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 340.0000 mm³."
