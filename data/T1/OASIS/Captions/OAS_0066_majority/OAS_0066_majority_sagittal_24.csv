description
"MRI image size (256, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, of sagittal section. We observe slice n°24 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 676.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5213.7500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 612.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 411.2500 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256) weighted in T1, revealing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with sagittal section n°24 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 676.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5213.7500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 612.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 411.2500 mm³."
