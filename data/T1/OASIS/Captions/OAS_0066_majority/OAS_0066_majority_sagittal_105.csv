description
"MRI size (256, 256) in weighting T1, presenting the head of a woman of 66 years old, with sagittal section. The observation is made on slice n°105 from the right hemisphere of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 131.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5521.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 230.0000 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 256) in T1, showing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with sagittal section n°105 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 131.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5521.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 230.0000 mm³."
"Magnetic resonance image (MRI) size (256, 256) capturing the head of a woman aged  of 66 years old, with a sequence weighted in T1 and sagittal section. The specific slice is number 105, counted from the right hemisphere of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 131.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5521.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 230.0000 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256) of a human head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, of sagittal section. We observe slice n°105 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 131.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5521.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 230.0000 mm³."
