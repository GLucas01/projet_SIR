description
"MRI image size (128, 256) of a human head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with coronal section. We carefully examine slice n°74 from the back of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 77.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 745.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 178.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1115.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 111.2500 mm³."
