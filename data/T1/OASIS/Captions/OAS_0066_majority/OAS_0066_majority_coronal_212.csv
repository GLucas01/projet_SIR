description
"MRI size (128, 256) in weighting T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old of coronal section. The observation focuses on slice n°212 from the back of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 211.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1283.7500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 161.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 73.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 793.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 197.5000 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) of a human head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, of coronal section. We observe slice n°212 starting from the back of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 211.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1283.7500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 161.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 73.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 793.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 197.5000 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1, presenting the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal sectionn°212 beginning at the back of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 211.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1283.7500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 161.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 73.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 793.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 197.5000 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°212 starting from the back of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 211.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1283.7500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 161.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 73.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 793.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 197.5000 mm³."
"MRI size (128, 256) in weighting T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old of coronal section. The observation focuses on slice n°212 from the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 211.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1283.7500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 161.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 73.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 793.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 197.5000 mm³."
