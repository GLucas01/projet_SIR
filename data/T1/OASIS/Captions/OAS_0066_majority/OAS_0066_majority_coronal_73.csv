description
"MRI size (128, 256) in weighting T1, showing the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°73 initiated from the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 40.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 695.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 138.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1081.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 82.5000 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1, exposing the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°73 starting from the back of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 40.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 695.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 138.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1081.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 82.5000 mm³."
