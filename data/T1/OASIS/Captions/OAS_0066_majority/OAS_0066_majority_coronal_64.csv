description
"MRI image size (128, 256) of a human head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, of coronal section. We observe slice n°64 starting from the back of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 67.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 36.2500 mm³."
