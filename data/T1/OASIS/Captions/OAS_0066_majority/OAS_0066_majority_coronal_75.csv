description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°75 starting from the back of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 111.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 783.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 226.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1140.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 102.5000 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) of a human head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, of coronal section. We observe slice n°75 starting from the back of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 111.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 783.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 226.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1140.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 102.5000 mm³ there."
"MRI size (128, 256) in weighting T1, showing the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°75 initiated from the back of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 111.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 783.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 226.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1140.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 102.5000 mm³."
"MRI size (128, 256) in weighting T1, showing the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°75 initiated from the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 111.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 783.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 226.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1140.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 102.5000 mm³."
