description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, revealing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°70 initiated from the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 455.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 28.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 922.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 76.2500 mm³."
"MRI size (128, 256) in weighting T1, presenting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section. The observation is made on slice n°70 from the back of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 455.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 28.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 922.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 76.2500 mm³."
