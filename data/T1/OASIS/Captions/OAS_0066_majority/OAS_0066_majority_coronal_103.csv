description
"MRI size (128, 256) in weighting T1, showing the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°103 initiated from the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1011.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1528.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1028.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1781.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 262.5000 mm³."
"Image in weighting T1 of the MRI size (128, 256), showing the head of a woman of 66 years old of coronal section. Slice n°103 is observed from the back of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1011.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1528.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1028.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1781.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 262.5000 mm³."
