description
"MRI size (128, 256) in weighting T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old of coronal section. The observation focuses on slice n°100 from the back of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 851.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1543.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1033.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1665.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 251.2500 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with coronal section. We carefully observe slice n°100 beginning from the back of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 851.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1543.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1033.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1665.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 251.2500 mm³."
