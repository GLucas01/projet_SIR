description
"Image in weighting T1 of the MRI size (128, 256), showing the head of a woman of 66 years old of coronal section. Slice n°216 is observed from the back of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 65.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 913.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 530.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 120.0000 mm³ there."
"MRI size (128, 256) in weighting T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old of coronal section. The observation focuses on slice n°216 from the back of the skull.

"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256) in T1, depicting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°216 beginning from the back of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 65.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 913.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 530.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 120.0000 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with coronal section. We carefully observe slice n°216 beginning from the back of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 65.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 913.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 530.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 120.0000 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, revealing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°216 initiated from the back of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 65.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 913.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 530.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 120.0000 mm³."
