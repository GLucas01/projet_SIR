description
"Image size (128, 256) with weighting in T1 of the MRI, showing the head of a woman of 66 years old of axial section. Slice n°61 is observed starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 38.7500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1197.5000 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 7.5000 mm³, the brainstem of volume 242.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3.7500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1181.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 157.5000 mm³."
"MRI representation size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, showing the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°61 initiated from the base of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 38.7500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1197.5000 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 7.5000 mm³, the brainstem of volume 242.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3.7500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1181.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 157.5000 mm³."
