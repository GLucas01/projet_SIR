description
"MRI size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, depicting the skull of a person a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°54 starting from the base of the skull. We observe the left cerebellar cortex of volume 140.0000 mm³, the brainstem of volume 98.7500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 140.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 82.5000 mm³ there."
"MRI image size (128, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with axial section. We observe slice n°54 beginning from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 140.0000 mm³, the brainstem of volume 98.7500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 140.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 82.5000 mm³."
