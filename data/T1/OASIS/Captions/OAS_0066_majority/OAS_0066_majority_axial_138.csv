description
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1, showing the skull of a person a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°138 starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 956.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3338.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 938.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3460.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 370.0000 mm³ in it."
