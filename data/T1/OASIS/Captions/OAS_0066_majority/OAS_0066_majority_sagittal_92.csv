description
"MRI image size (256, 256) weighted in T1, revealing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with sagittal section n°92 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3000.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 7053.7500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 727.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 487.5000 mm³."
"MRI size (256, 256) in weighting T1, showing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with sagittal section n°92 initiated from the right hemisphere of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3000.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 7053.7500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 727.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 487.5000 mm³."
