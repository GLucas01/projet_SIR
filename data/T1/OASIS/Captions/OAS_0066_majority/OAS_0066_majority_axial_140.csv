description
"Weighted MRI visualization size (128, 256) in T1 of the skull of a woman of 66 years old, with axial section n°140 starting at the base of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 800.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3077.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 781.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3223.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 361.2500 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with axial section. We carefully observe slice n°140 beginning from the base of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 800.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3077.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 781.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3223.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 361.2500 mm³."
