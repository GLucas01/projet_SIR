description
"MRI image size (256, 256) of a human head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with sagittal section. We observe slice n°39 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3551.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6527.5000 mm³, the right lateral ventricle of volume 75.0000 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 211.2500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1420.0000 mm³, the right hippocampus of volume 116.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 616.2500 mm³."
"Magnetic resonance image (MRI) size (256, 256) capturing the head of a woman aged  of 66 years old, with a sequence weighted in T1 and sagittal section. The specific slice is number 39, counted from the right hemisphere of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3551.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6527.5000 mm³, the right lateral ventricle of volume 75.0000 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 211.2500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1420.0000 mm³, the right hippocampus of volume 116.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 616.2500 mm³."
