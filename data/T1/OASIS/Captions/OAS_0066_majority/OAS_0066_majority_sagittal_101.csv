description
"MRI image size (256, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with sagittal section. We observe slice n°101 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 781.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6633.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 435.0000 mm³."
