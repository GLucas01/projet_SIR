description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°209 starting from the back of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 370.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1326.2500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 455.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 176.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 980.0000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 116.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 290.0000 mm³."
"MRI size (128, 256) in weighting T1, presenting the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section. The observation is made on slice n°209 from the back of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 370.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1326.2500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 455.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 176.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 980.0000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 116.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 290.0000 mm³."
