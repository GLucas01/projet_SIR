description
"MRI size (128, 256) in weighting T1, presenting the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section. The observation is made on slice n°94 from the back of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 658.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1460.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 817.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1685.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 210.0000 mm³ there."
"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256) in T1, representing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°94 starting at the back of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 658.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1460.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 817.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1685.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 210.0000 mm³."
"MRI size (128, 256) in weighting T1, showing the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°94 initiated from the back of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 658.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1460.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 817.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1685.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 210.0000 mm³."
