description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, revealing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°220 initiated from the back of the skull. The following elements are present : the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 562.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 151.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 31.2500 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with coronal section. We carefully observe slice n°220 beginning from the back of the skull. We see clearly: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 562.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 151.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 31.2500 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) of a human head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with coronal section. We carefully examine slice n°220 from the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 562.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 151.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 31.2500 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old, in slice coronal n°220 starting from the back of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 562.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 151.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 31.2500 mm³."
"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256) in T1, depicting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°220 beginning from the back of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 562.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 151.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 31.2500 mm³."
