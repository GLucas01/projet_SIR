description
"MRI size (256, 256) in weighting T1, showing the head of a woman of 66 years old, of sagittal section n°96 initiated from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2163.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6945.0000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 315.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 530.0000 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 256) in T1, revealing the head of a woman of 66 years old, of sagittal section n°96 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2163.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6945.0000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 315.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 530.0000 mm³."
