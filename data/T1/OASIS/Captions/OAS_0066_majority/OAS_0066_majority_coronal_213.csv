description
"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256) in T1, depicting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°213 beginning from the back of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 172.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1177.5000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 76.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 36.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 771.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 181.2500 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, of coronal section. We observe slice n°213 starting from the back of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 172.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1177.5000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 76.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 36.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 771.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 181.2500 mm³."

"MRI image size (128, 256) of a human head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with coronal section. We carefully examine slice n°213 from the back of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 172.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1177.5000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 76.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 36.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 771.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 181.2500 mm³."
