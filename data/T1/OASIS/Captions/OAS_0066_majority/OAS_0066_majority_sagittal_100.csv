description
"MRI image size (256, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, of sagittal section. We observe slice n°100 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1082.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6731.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 433.7500 mm³."
