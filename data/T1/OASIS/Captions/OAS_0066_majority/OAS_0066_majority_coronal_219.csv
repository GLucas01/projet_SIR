description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, revealing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°219 initiated from the back of the skull. The observed details include the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 647.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 248.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 47.5000 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with coronal section. We carefully observe slice n°219 beginning from the back of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 647.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 248.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 47.5000 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256) with weighted imaging in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°219 beginning from the back of the skull. We see the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 647.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 248.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 47.5000 mm³."
