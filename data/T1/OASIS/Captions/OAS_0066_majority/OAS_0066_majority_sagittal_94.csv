description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 256) in T1, exhibiting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of sagittal section n°94 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2500.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 7100.0000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 525.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 498.7500 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (256, 256) in weighted T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old, of sagittal section n°94 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2500.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 7100.0000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 525.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 498.7500 mm³."
