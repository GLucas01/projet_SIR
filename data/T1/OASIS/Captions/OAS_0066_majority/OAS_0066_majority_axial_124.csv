description
"MRI image size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, presenting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section. The observation is made on slice n°124 starting from the base of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2790.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3593.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2882.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3456.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 610.0000 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) with weighted imaging in T1, depicting the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°124 beginning from the base of the skull.
