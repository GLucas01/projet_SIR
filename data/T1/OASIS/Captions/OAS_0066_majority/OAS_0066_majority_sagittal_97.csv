description
"MRI size (256, 256) in weighting T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old of sagittal section. The observation focuses on slice n°97 from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1973.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6812.5000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 228.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 572.5000 mm³."
