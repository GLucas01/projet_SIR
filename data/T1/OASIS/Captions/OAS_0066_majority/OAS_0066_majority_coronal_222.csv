description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°222 starting from the back of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 335.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 31.2500 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1, presenting the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal sectionn°222 beginning at the back of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 335.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 31.2500 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with coronal section. We carefully observe slice n°222 beginning from the back of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 335.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 31.2500 mm³."
