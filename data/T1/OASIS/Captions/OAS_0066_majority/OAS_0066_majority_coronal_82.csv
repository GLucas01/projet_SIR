description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°82 starting from the back of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 283.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1117.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 483.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1353.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 145.0000 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1 showing the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°82 starting from the back of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 283.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1117.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 483.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1353.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 145.0000 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, of coronal section. We observe slice n°82 starting from the back of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 283.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1117.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 483.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1353.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 145.0000 mm³."
"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256) in T1, representing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°82 starting at the back of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 283.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1117.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 483.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1353.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 145.0000 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) of a human head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, of coronal section. We observe slice n°82 starting from the back of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 283.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1117.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 483.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1353.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 145.0000 mm³."
