description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°150 starting from the base of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 30.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1737.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 8.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1746.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 141.2500 mm³."
"MRI representation size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, showing the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°150 initiated from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 30.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1737.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 8.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1746.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 141.2500 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old with weighting in T1, of axial section. We observe slice n°150 beginning from the base of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 30.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1737.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 8.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1746.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 141.2500 mm³."
