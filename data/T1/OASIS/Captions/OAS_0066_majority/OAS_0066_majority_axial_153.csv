description
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old with weighting in T1, of axial section. We observe slice n°153 beginning from the base of the skull. We distinguishe the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 998.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1042.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 137.5000 mm³ in it."
