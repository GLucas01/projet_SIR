description
"Image size (128, 256) with weighting in T1 of the MRI, showing the head of a woman of 66 years old of axial section. Slice n°152 is observed starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1240.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1287.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 135.0000 mm³ in it."
