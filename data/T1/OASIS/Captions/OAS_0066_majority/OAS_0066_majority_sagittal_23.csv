description
"MRI image size (256, 256) in weighting T1 of a woman of 66 years old, with sagittal section n°23 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 440.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5140.0000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 488.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 343.7500 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256) of a human head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with sagittal section. We observe slice n°23 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 440.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5140.0000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 488.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 343.7500 mm³."
