description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, revealing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°92 initiated from the back of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 577.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1415.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 773.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1646.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 208.7500 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°92 starting from the back of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 577.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1415.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 773.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1646.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 208.7500 mm³ there."
"MRI size (128, 256) in weighting T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old of coronal section. The observation focuses on slice n°92 from the back of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 577.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1415.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 773.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1646.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 208.7500 mm³."
