description
"Weighted MRI image size (256, 256) in T1, representing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with sagittal section n°89 beginning from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3922.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6660.0000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1006.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 511.2500 mm³."
"MRI size (256, 256) in weighting T1, showing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with sagittal section n°89 initiated from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3922.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6660.0000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1006.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 511.2500 mm³."
