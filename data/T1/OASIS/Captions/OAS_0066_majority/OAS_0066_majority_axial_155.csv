description
"Weighted MRI size(128, 256) in T1 illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, with axial section n°155 starting from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 490.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 530.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 140.0000 mm³."
"MRI representation size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, showing the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°155 initiated from the base of the skull. The section reveals the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 490.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 530.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 140.0000 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old with weighting in T1, of axial section. We observe slice n°155 beginning from the base of the skull. We see clearly: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 490.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 530.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 140.0000 mm³."
