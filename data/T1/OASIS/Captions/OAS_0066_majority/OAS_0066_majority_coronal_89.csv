description
"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256) in T1, representing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°89 starting at the back of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 477.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1338.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 700.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1572.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 202.5000 mm³."
"MRI size (128, 256) in weighting T1, presenting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section. The observation is made on slice n°89 from the back of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 477.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1338.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 700.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1572.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 202.5000 mm³."
