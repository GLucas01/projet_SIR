description
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256) with weighted imaging in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°83 beginning from the back of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 305.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1172.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 518.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1383.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 148.7500 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with coronal section. We observe slice n°83 starting at the back of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 305.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1172.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 518.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1383.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 148.7500 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old, in slice coronal n°83 starting from the back of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 305.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1172.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 518.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1383.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 148.7500 mm³."

"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with coronal section. We carefully observe slice n°83 beginning from the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 305.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1172.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 518.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1383.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 148.7500 mm³."
