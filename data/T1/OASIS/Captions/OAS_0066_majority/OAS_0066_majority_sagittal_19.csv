description
"MRI image size (256, 256) weighted in T1, revealing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with sagittal section n°19 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 42.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3943.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 137.5000 mm³."
