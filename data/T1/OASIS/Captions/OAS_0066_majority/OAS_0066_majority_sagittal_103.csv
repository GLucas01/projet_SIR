"MRI image size (256, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with sagittal section. We observe slice n°103 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 345.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6231.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 381.2500 mm³."
