description
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1, showing the skull of a person a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°135 starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1135.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3733.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1067.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3796.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 473.7500 mm³ in it."
"MRI image size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, presenting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section. The observation is made on slice n°135 starting from the base of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1135.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3733.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1067.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3796.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 473.7500 mm³."
"Visualization in weighting T1 of the MRI size (128, 256), showing the head of a woman of 66 years old of axial section. Slice n°135 is observed from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1135.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3733.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1067.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3796.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 473.7500 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with axial section. We observe slice n°135 beginning from the base of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1135.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3733.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1067.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3796.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 473.7500 mm³."
