description
"MRI image size (128, 256) of a human head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, of coronal section. We observe slice n°97 starting from the back of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 760.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1505.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 948.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1662.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 242.5000 mm³."
"MRI size (128, 256) in weighting T1, showing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°97 starting from the back of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 760.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1505.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 948.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1662.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 242.5000 mm³."
