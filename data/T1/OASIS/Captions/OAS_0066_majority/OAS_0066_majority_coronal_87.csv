description
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256) with weighted imaging in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°87 beginning from the back of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 433.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1300.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 626.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1516.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 172.5000 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°87 starting from the back of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 433.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1300.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 626.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1516.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 172.5000 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old, in slice coronal n°87 starting from the back of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 433.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1300.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 626.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1516.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 172.5000 mm³."
"MRI size (128, 256) in weighting T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old of coronal section. The observation focuses on slice n°87 from the back of the skull.

"MRI image size (128, 256) of a human head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, of coronal section. We observe slice n°87 starting from the back of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 433.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1300.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 626.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1516.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 172.5000 mm³."
