description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°79 starting from the back of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 223.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1005.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 338.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1322.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 120.0000 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1 showing the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°79 starting from the back of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 223.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1005.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 338.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1322.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 120.0000 mm³."
