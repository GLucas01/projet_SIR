description
"MRI image size (256, 256) in weighting T1 of a woman of 66 years old, with sagittal section n°104 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 226.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5895.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 297.5000 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256) weighted in T1, revealing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with sagittal section n°104 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 226.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5895.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 297.5000 mm³ in it."
"MRI image size (256, 256) in weighting T1, presenting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of sagittal section. The observation is made on slice n°104 from the right hemisphere of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 226.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5895.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 297.5000 mm³."
