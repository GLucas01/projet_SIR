description
"MRI image size (256, 256) of a human head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with sagittal section. We observe slice n°34 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3242.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6076.2500 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 41.2500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1333.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 493.7500 mm³."
