description
"MRI image size (128, 256) with weighted imaging in T1, depicting the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°63 beginning from the base of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 347.5000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1368.7500 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 10.0000 mm³, the brainstem of volume 265.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 267.5000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1371.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 182.5000 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old with weighting in T1, of axial section. We observe slice n°63 beginning from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 347.5000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1368.7500 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 10.0000 mm³, the brainstem of volume 265.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 267.5000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1371.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 182.5000 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, presenting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section. The observation is made on slice n°63 starting from the base of the skull.

"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1, exposing the skull of a person a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°63 beginning from the base of the skull. We distinguishe the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 347.5000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1368.7500 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 10.0000 mm³, the brainstem of volume 265.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 267.5000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1371.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 182.5000 mm³ in it."
