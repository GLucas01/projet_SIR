description
"MRI size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, depicting the skull of a person a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°121 starting from the base of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3250.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3428.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3262.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3417.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 568.7500 mm³."
"Illustration size (128, 256) by MRI of the head of a woman of 66 years old with weighting in T1, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°121 starting from the base of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3250.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3428.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3262.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3417.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 568.7500 mm³."
"MRI size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, depicting the skull of a person a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°121 starting from the base of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3250.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3428.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3262.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3417.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 568.7500 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size(128, 256) in T1 illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, with axial section n°121 starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3250.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3428.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3262.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3417.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 568.7500 mm³ in it."
"MRI image size (128, 256) with weighted imaging in T1, depicting the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°121 beginning from the base of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3250.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3428.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3262.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3417.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 568.7500 mm³."
