description
"MRI size (256, 256) in weighting T1, showing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with sagittal section n°29 initiated from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1816.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5855.0000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1048.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 502.5000 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (256, 256) weighted in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old, with sagittal section n°29 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1816.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5855.0000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1048.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 502.5000 mm³."
