description
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256) with weighting in T1 describing the skull of a woman of age  of 66 years old, of axial section n°147 from the base of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 127.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2371.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 112.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2376.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 222.5000 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, presenting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section. The observation is made on slice n°147 starting from the base of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 127.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2371.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 112.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2376.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 222.5000 mm³."

"MRI size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, depicting the skull of a person a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°147 starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 127.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2371.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 112.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2376.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 222.5000 mm³ in it."
"Illustration size (128, 256) by MRI of the head of a woman of 66 years old with weighting in T1, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°147 starting from the base of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 127.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2371.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 112.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2376.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 222.5000 mm³."
