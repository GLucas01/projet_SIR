description
"MRI representation size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, showing the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°136 initiated from the base of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1085.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3600.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1055.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3663.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 430.0000 mm³ there."
"MRI size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old of axial section. The observation focuses on slice n°136 starting from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1085.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3600.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1055.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3663.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 430.0000 mm³."

"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) visualization in T1 of the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°136 starting at the base of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1085.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3600.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1055.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3663.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 430.0000 mm³."
