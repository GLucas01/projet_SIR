description
"Image size (128, 256) with weighting in T1 of the MRI, showing the head of a woman of 66 years old of axial section. Slice n°58 is observed starting from the base of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 890.0000 mm³, the brainstem of volume 206.2500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 881.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 88.7500 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256) with weighting in T1 describing the skull of a woman of age  of 66 years old, of axial section n°58 from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 890.0000 mm³, the brainstem of volume 206.2500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 881.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 88.7500 mm³."
