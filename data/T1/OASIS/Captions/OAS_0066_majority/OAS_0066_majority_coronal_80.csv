description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°80 starting from the back of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 241.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1050.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 400.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1327.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 123.7500 mm³."
"MRI size (128, 256) in weighting T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old of coronal section. The observation focuses on slice n°80 from the back of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 241.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1050.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 400.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1327.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 123.7500 mm³."
