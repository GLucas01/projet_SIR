description
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256) with weighting in T1 describing the skull of a woman of age  of 66 years old, of axial section n°137 from the base of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1060.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3448.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 978.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3571.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 421.2500 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, describing the skull of a woman of age  of 66 years old, of axial section n°137 from the base of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1060.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3448.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 978.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3571.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 421.2500 mm³ there."
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1, showing the skull of a person a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°137 starting from the base of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1060.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3448.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 978.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3571.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 421.2500 mm³."
