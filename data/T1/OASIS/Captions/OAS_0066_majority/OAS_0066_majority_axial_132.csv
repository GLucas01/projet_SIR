description
"Illustration size (128, 256) by MRI of the head of a woman of 66 years old with weighting in T1, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°132 starting from the base of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1278.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4088.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1471.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3886.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 507.5000 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) with weighted imaging in T1, depicting the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°132 beginning from the base of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1278.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4088.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1471.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3886.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 507.5000 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256) with weighting in T1 describing the skull of a woman of age  of 66 years old, of axial section n°132 from the base of the skull.
