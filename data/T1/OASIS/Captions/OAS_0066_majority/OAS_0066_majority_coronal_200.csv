description
"MRI size (128, 256) in weighting T1, presenting the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section. The observation is made on slice n°200 from the back of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 652.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1636.2500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1055.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 532.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1203.7500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 740.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 312.5000 mm³."
"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256) in T1, representing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°200 starting at the back of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 652.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1636.2500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1055.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 532.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1203.7500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 740.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 312.5000 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, revealing the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°200 beginning from the back of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 652.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1636.2500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1055.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 532.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1203.7500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 740.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 312.5000 mm³ in it."
"MRI image size (128, 256) of a human head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, of coronal section. We observe slice n°200 starting from the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 652.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1636.2500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1055.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 532.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1203.7500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 740.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 312.5000 mm³."
