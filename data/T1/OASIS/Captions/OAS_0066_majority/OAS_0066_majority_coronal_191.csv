description
"MRI size (128, 256) in weighting T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old of coronal section. The observation focuses on slice n°191 from the back of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 657.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2201.2500 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 146.2500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1256.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 641.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1661.2500 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 86.2500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1113.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 358.7500 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256) with weighted imaging in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°191 beginning from the back of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 657.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2201.2500 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 146.2500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1256.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 641.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1661.2500 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 86.2500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1113.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 358.7500 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, revealing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°191 initiated from the back of the skull.
