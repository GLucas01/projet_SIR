description
"MRI size (128, 256) in weighting T1, presenting the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section. The observation is made on slice n°189 from the back of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 680.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2272.5000 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 192.5000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1280.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 616.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1750.0000 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 123.7500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1165.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 383.7500 mm³ there."
