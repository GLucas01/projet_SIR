description
"MRI image size (128, 256) of a human head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, of coronal section. We observe slice n°205 starting from the back of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 536.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1452.5000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 725.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 356.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1085.0000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 423.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 273.7500 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, revealing the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°205 beginning from the back of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 536.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1452.5000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 725.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 356.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1085.0000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 423.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 273.7500 mm³."

"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, revealing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°205 initiated from the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 536.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1452.5000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 725.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 356.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1085.0000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 423.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 273.7500 mm³."
