description
"Weighted MRI image size (256, 256) in T1, representing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with sagittal section n°112 beginning from the right hemisphere of the skull. The following elements are present : the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1077.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 148.7500 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, of sagittal section. We observe slice n°112 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The section reveals the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1077.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 148.7500 mm³."
