description
"MRI image size (256, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, of sagittal section. We observe slice n°91 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3242.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 7002.5000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 826.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 445.0000 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 256) in T1, exhibiting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of sagittal section n°91 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3242.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 7002.5000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 826.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 445.0000 mm³."
