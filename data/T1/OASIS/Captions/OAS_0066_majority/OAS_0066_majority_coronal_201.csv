description
"MRI image size (128, 256) of a human head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with coronal section. We carefully examine slice n°201 from the back of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 641.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1591.2500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 973.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 461.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1183.7500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 685.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 333.7500 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with coronal section. We carefully observe slice n°201 beginning from the back of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 641.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1591.2500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 973.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 461.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1183.7500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 685.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 333.7500 mm³ in it."
