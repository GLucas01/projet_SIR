"MRI image size (256, 256) in weighting T1 of a woman of 66 years old, with sagittal section n°113 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 130.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 98.7500 mm³."
"MRI size (256, 256) in weighting T1, presenting the head of a woman of 66 years old, with sagittal section. The observation is made on slice n°113 from the right hemisphere of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 130.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 98.7500 mm³."
