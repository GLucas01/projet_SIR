description
"Image size (128, 256) with weighting in T1 of the MRI, showing the head of a woman of 66 years old of axial section. Slice n°134 is observed starting from the base of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1173.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3881.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1147.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3872.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 468.7500 mm³ there."
