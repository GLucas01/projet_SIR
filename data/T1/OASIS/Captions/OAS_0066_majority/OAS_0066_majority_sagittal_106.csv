description
"MRI image size (256, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with sagittal section. We observe slice n°106 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 63.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5030.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 235.0000 mm³."
