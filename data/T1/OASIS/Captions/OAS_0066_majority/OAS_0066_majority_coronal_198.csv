description
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1 showing the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°198 starting from the back of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 671.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1753.7500 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 3.7500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1157.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 556.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1325.0000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 882.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 313.7500 mm³."
"MRI size (128, 256) in weighting T1, presenting the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section. The observation is made on slice n°198 from the back of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 671.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1753.7500 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 3.7500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1157.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 556.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1325.0000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 882.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 313.7500 mm³."
"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256) in T1, representing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°198 starting at the back of the skull.
