description
"MRI image size (256, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, of sagittal section. We observe slice n°99 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1405.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6716.2500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 516.2500 mm³."
