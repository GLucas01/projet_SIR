description
"Weighted MRI size (256, 256) in T1, exhibiting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of sagittal section n°26 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1167.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5426.2500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 811.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 448.7500 mm³."
