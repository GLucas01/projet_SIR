description
"Image in weighting T1 of the MRI size (128, 256), showing the head of a woman of 66 years old of coronal section. Slice n°105 is observed from the back of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1017.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1586.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1066.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1911.2500 mm³, the right lateral ventricle of volume 17.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 255.0000 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°105 starting from the back of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1017.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1586.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1066.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1911.2500 mm³, the right lateral ventricle of volume 17.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 255.0000 mm³."
