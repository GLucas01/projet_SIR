description
"Weighted MRI image size (256, 256) in T1, representing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with sagittal section n°109 beginning from the right hemisphere of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3130.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 157.5000 mm³."
