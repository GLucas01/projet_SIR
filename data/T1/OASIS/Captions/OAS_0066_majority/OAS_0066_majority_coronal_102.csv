description
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256) with weighted imaging in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°102 beginning from the back of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 973.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1521.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1048.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1765.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 227.5000 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, of coronal section. We observe slice n°102 starting from the back of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 973.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1521.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1048.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1765.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 227.5000 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1, exposing the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°102 starting from the back of the skull.
