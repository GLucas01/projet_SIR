description
"MRI image size (128, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, of coronal section. We observe slice n°96 beginning from the back of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 718.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1510.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 896.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1670.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 216.2500 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old, in slice coronal n°96 starting from the back of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 718.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1510.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 896.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1670.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 216.2500 mm³ in it."
"MRI size (128, 256) in weighting T1, showing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°96 starting from the back of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 718.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1510.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 896.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1670.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 216.2500 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, revealing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°96 initiated from the back of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 718.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1510.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 896.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1670.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 216.2500 mm³."
