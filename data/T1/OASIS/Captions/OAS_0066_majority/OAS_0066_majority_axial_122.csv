description
"Weighted MRI visualization size (128, 256) in T1 of the skull of a woman of 66 years old, with axial section n°122 starting at the base of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3125.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3462.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3175.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3410.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 572.5000 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) with weighted imaging in T1, depicting the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°122 beginning from the base of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3125.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3462.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3175.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3410.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 572.5000 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256) with weighted imaging in T1, illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°122 starting from the base of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3125.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3462.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3175.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3410.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 572.5000 mm³."
