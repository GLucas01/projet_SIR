description
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1, exhibiting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°223 starting from the back of the skull. We observe the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 208.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 23.7500 mm³ there."
"MRI image size (128, 256) of a human head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with coronal section. We carefully examine slice n°223 from the back of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 208.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 23.7500 mm³."
