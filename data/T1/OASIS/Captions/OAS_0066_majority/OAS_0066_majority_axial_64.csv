description
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) visualization in T1 of the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°64 starting at the base of the skull. The following elements are present : the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 470.0000 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 2.5000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1460.0000 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 8.7500 mm³, the brainstem of volume 293.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 410.0000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1441.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 220.0000 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) visualization in T1 of the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°64 starting at the base of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 470.0000 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 2.5000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1460.0000 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 8.7500 mm³, the brainstem of volume 293.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 410.0000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1441.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 220.0000 mm³."
"Illustration size (128, 256) by MRI of the head of a woman of 66 years old with weighting in T1, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°64 starting from the base of the skull. The observed details include: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 470.0000 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 2.5000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1460.0000 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 8.7500 mm³, the brainstem of volume 293.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 410.0000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1441.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 220.0000 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1, exposing the skull of a person a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°64 beginning from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 470.0000 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 2.5000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1460.0000 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 8.7500 mm³, the brainstem of volume 293.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 410.0000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1441.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 220.0000 mm³."
