description
"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256) in T1, depicting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°67 beginning from the back of the skull. The following elements are present : the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 108.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 538.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 52.5000 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°67 starting from the back of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 108.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 538.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 52.5000 mm³."

"MRI image size (128, 256) of a human head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with coronal section. We carefully examine slice n°67 from the back of the skull. We see the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 108.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 538.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 52.5000 mm³."
