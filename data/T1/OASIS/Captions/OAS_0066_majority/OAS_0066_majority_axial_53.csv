description
"Image size (128, 256) with weighting in T1 of the MRI, showing the head of a woman of 66 years old of axial section. Slice n°53 is observed starting from the base of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the left cerebellar cortex of volume 56.2500 mm³, the brainstem of volume 73.7500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 67.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 55.0000 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, presenting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section. The observation is made on slice n°53 starting from the base of the skull. We see the left cerebellar cortex of volume 56.2500 mm³, the brainstem of volume 73.7500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 67.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 55.0000 mm³."
"Illustration size (128, 256) by MRI of the head of a woman of 66 years old with weighting in T1, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°53 starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 56.2500 mm³, the brainstem of volume 73.7500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 67.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 55.0000 mm³."

"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1, showing the skull of a person a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°53 starting from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 56.2500 mm³, the brainstem of volume 73.7500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 67.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 55.0000 mm³."
