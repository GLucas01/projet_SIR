description
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old, in slice coronal n°88 starting from the back of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 476.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1320.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 670.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1558.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 156.2500 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with coronal section. We carefully observe slice n°88 beginning from the back of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 476.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1320.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 670.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1558.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 156.2500 mm³."
