description
"Image size (256, 256) in weighting T1 of the MRI, showing the head of a woman of 66 years old of sagittal section. Slice n°36 is observed starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3407.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6396.2500 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 95.0000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1406.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 505.0000 mm³."
