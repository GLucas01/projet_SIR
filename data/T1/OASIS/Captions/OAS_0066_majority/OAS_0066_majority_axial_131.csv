description
"Weighted MRI visualization size (128, 256) in T1 of the skull of a woman of 66 years old, with axial section n°131 starting at the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1421.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4092.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1591.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3913.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 496.2500 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with axial section. We carefully observe slice n°131 beginning from the base of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1421.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4092.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1591.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3913.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 496.2500 mm³."
