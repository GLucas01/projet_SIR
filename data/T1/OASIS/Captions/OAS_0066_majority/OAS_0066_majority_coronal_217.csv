description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°217 starting from the back of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 13.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 883.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 428.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 75.0000 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1, presenting the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal sectionn°217 beginning at the back of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 13.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 883.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 428.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 75.0000 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with coronal section. We observe slice n°217 starting at the back of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 13.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 883.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 428.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 75.0000 mm³."
