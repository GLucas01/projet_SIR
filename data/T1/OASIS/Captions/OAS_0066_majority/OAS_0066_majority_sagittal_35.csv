description
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) size (256, 256) capture representing the head of a woman aged  of 66 years old, with a sequence weighted in T1 and sagittal section, starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3335.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6211.2500 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 66.2500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1375.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 511.2500 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 256) in T1, showing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with sagittal section n°35 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3335.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6211.2500 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 66.2500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1375.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 511.2500 mm³."
