description
"MRI representation size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, showing the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°55 initiated from the base of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 376.2500 mm³, the brainstem of volume 132.5000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 272.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 205.0000 mm³."
"MRI size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old of axial section. The observation focuses on slice n°55 starting from the base of the skull. The following elements are present : the left cerebellar cortex of volume 376.2500 mm³, the brainstem of volume 132.5000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 272.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 205.0000 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256) with weighted imaging in T1, illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°55 starting from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 376.2500 mm³, the brainstem of volume 132.5000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 272.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 205.0000 mm³."
