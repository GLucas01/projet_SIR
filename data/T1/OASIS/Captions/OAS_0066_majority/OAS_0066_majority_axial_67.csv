description
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256) with weighting in T1 describing the skull of a woman of age  of 66 years old, of axial section n°67 from the base of the skull. The following elements are present : the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 761.2500 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 238.7500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1463.7500 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 16.2500 mm³, the brainstem of volume 456.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 781.2500 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 221.2500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1425.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 266.2500 mm³."
"Illustration size (128, 256) by MRI of the head of a woman of 66 years old with weighting in T1, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°67 starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 761.2500 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 238.7500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1463.7500 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 16.2500 mm³, the brainstem of volume 456.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 781.2500 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 221.2500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1425.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 266.2500 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old with weighting in T1, of axial section. We observe slice n°67 beginning from the base of the skull. The observed details include: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 761.2500 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 238.7500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1463.7500 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 16.2500 mm³, the brainstem of volume 456.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 781.2500 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 221.2500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1425.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 266.2500 mm³."
