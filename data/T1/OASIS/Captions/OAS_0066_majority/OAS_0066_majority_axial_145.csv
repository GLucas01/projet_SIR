description
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old with weighting in T1, of axial section n°145. We observe slice n°145 starting from the base of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 253.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2562.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 255.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2700.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 345.0000 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with axial section. We observe slice n°145 beginning from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 253.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2562.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 255.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2700.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 345.0000 mm³."
