description
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256) with weighted imaging in T1, illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°52 starting from the base of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 6.2500 mm³, the brainstem of volume 42.5000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 3.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 23.7500 mm³."
"Illustration size (128, 256) by MRI of the head of a woman of 66 years old with weighting in T1, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°52 starting from the base of the skull. The observed details include the left cerebellar cortex of volume 6.2500 mm³, the brainstem of volume 42.5000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 3.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 23.7500 mm³."
