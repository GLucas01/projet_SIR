description
"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256) in T1, representing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°66 starting at the back of the skull. The observed details include the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 8.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 367.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 53.7500 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) of a human head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, of coronal section. We observe slice n°66 starting from the back of the skull. The section reveals the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 8.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 367.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 53.7500 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old, in slice coronal n°66 starting from the back of the skull. The section reveals the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 8.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 367.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 53.7500 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, of coronal section. We observe slice n°66 starting from the back of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 8.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 367.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 53.7500 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1, exposing the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°66 starting from the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 8.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 367.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 53.7500 mm³."
