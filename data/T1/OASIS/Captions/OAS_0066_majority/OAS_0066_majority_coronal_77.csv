description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°77 starting from the back of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 168.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 905.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 283.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1248.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 105.0000 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, of coronal section. We observe slice n°77 beginning from the back of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 168.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 905.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 283.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1248.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 105.0000 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1, exposing the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°77 starting from the back of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 168.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 905.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 283.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1248.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 105.0000 mm³."
