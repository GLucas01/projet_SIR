description
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1, showing the skull of a person a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°123 starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2965.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3530.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3037.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3393.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 615.0000 mm³ in it."
"MRI size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old of axial section. The observation focuses on slice n°123 starting from the base of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2965.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3530.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3037.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3393.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 615.0000 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) visualization in T1 of the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°123 starting at the base of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2965.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3530.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3037.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3393.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 615.0000 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with axial section. We carefully observe slice n°123 beginning from the base of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2965.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3530.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3037.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3393.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 615.0000 mm³."
"Illustration size (128, 256) by MRI of the head of a woman of 66 years old with weighting in T1, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°123 starting from the base of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2965.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3530.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3037.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3393.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 615.0000 mm³."
