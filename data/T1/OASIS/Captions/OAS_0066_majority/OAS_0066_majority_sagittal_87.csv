description
"Weighted MRI image size (256, 256) in T1, representing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with sagittal section n°87 beginning from the right hemisphere of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4847.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 5760.0000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1168.7500 mm³, the left putamen of volume 116.2500 mm³, the left hippocampus of volume 86.2500 mm³, the left amygdala of volume 1.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 593.7500 mm³."
