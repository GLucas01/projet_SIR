description
"MRI size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old of axial section. The observation focuses on slice n°158 starting from the base of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 16.2500 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256) with weighting in T1 describing the skull of a woman of age  of 66 years old, of axial section n°158 from the base of the skull. We distinguishe the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 16.2500 mm³ in it."
