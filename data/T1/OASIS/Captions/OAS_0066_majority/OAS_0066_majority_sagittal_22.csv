description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (256, 256) in T1, revealing the head of a woman of 66 years old, of sagittal section n°22 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 256.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4970.0000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 350.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 303.7500 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (256, 256) weighted in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old, with sagittal section n°22 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 256.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4970.0000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 350.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 303.7500 mm³."
