description
"MRI snapshot size (256, 256) in weighted T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old, of sagittal section n°102 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 552.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6483.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 363.7500 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256) in weighting T1 of a woman of 66 years old, with sagittal section n°102 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 552.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6483.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 363.7500 mm³."
"MRI size (256, 256) in weighting T1, showing the head of a woman of 66 years old, of sagittal section n°102 initiated from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 552.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6483.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 363.7500 mm³."
"MRI size (256, 256) in weighting T1, presenting the head of a woman of 66 years old, with sagittal section. The observation is made on slice n°102 from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 552.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6483.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 363.7500 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256) of a human head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with sagittal section. We observe slice n°102 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 552.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6483.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 363.7500 mm³."
