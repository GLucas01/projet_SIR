description
"MRI image size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, describing the skull of a woman of age  of 66 years old, of axial section n°143 from the base of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 458.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2768.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 452.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2935.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 363.7500 mm³."
"MRI representation size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, showing the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°143 initiated from the base of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 458.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2768.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 452.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2935.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 363.7500 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) visualization in T1 of the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°143 starting at the base of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 458.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2768.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 452.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2935.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 363.7500 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with axial section. We observe slice n°143 beginning from the base of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 458.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2768.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 452.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2935.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 363.7500 mm³."
