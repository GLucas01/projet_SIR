description
"MRI image size (128, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, of coronal section. We observe slice n°85 beginning from the back of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 378.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1226.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 567.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1453.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 175.0000 mm³."
