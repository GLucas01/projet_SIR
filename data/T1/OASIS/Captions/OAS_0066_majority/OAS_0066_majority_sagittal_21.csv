description
"MRI image size (256, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, of sagittal section. We observe slice n°21 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 150.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4726.2500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 190.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 227.5000 mm³."
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) size (256, 256) capture representing the head of a woman aged  of 66 years old, with a sequence weighted in T1 and sagittal section, starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 150.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4726.2500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 190.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 227.5000 mm³."

"Weighted MRI size (256, 256) in T1, exhibiting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of sagittal section n°21 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 150.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4726.2500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 190.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 227.5000 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (256, 256) weighted in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old, with sagittal section n°21 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 150.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4726.2500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 190.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 227.5000 mm³ in it."
