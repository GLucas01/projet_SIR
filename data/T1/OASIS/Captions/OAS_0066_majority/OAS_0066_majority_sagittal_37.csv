description
"MRI image size (256, 256) in weighting T1, presenting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of sagittal section. The observation is made on slice n°37 from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3393.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6616.2500 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 126.2500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1428.7500 mm³, the right hippocampus of volume 2.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 521.2500 mm³."
"Magnetic resonance image (MRI) size (256, 256) capturing the head of a woman aged  of 66 years old, with a sequence weighted in T1 and sagittal section. The specific slice is number 37, counted from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3393.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6616.2500 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 126.2500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1428.7500 mm³, the right hippocampus of volume 2.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 521.2500 mm³."
