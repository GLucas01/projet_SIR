description
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with coronal section. We carefully observe slice n°101 beginning from the back of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 932.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1515.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1055.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1697.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 248.7500 mm³ there."
