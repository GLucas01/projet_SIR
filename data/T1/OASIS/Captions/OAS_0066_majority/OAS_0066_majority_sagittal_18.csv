description
"MRI snapshot size (256, 256) weighted in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old, with sagittal section n°18 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 12.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3506.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 95.0000 mm³."
