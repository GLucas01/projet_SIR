description
"Weighted MRI size(128, 256) in T1 illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, with axial section n°127 starting from the base of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2063.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3926.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2146.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3840.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 652.5000 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1, exposing the skull of a person a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°127 beginning from the base of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2063.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3926.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2146.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3840.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 652.5000 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, presenting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section. The observation is made on slice n°127 starting from the base of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2063.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3926.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2146.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3840.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 652.5000 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with axial section. We observe slice n°127 beginning from the base of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2063.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3926.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2146.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3840.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 652.5000 mm³ in it."
