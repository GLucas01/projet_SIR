description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°84 starting from the back of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 347.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1196.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 542.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1416.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 160.0000 mm³ there."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°84 starting from the back of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 347.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1196.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 542.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1416.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 160.0000 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with coronal section. We carefully observe slice n°84 beginning from the back of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 347.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1196.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 542.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1416.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 160.0000 mm³."
