description
"MRI snapshot size (256, 256) weighted in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old, with sagittal section n°20 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 77.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4401.2500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 38.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 187.5000 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with sagittal section. We observe slice n°20 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 77.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4401.2500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 38.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 187.5000 mm³."
"Weighted MRI image size (256, 256) in T1, depicting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of sagittal section n°20 beginning from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 77.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4401.2500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 38.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 187.5000 mm³."
