description
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old with weighting in T1, of axial section n°62. We observe slice n°62 starting from the base of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 223.7500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1285.0000 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 10.0000 mm³, the brainstem of volume 246.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 147.5000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1272.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 158.7500 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with axial section. We observe slice n°62 beginning from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 223.7500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1285.0000 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 10.0000 mm³, the brainstem of volume 246.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 147.5000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1272.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 158.7500 mm³."
"MRI representation size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, showing the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°62 initiated from the base of the skull. We see the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 223.7500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1285.0000 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 10.0000 mm³, the brainstem of volume 246.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 147.5000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1272.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 158.7500 mm³."
