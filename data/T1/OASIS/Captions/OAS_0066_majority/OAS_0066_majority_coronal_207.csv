description
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1 showing the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°207 starting from the back of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 456.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1417.5000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 596.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 246.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1067.5000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 277.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 291.2500 mm³."
"MRI size (128, 256) in weighting T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old of coronal section. The observation focuses on slice n°207 from the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 456.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1417.5000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 596.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 246.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1067.5000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 277.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 291.2500 mm³."

"MRI image size (128, 256) of a human head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with coronal section. We carefully examine slice n°207 from the back of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 456.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1417.5000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 596.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 246.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1067.5000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 277.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 291.2500 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old, in slice coronal n°207 starting from the back of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 456.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1417.5000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 596.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 246.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1067.5000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 277.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 291.2500 mm³."
