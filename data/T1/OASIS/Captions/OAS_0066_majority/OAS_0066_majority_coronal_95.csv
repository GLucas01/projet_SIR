description
"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256) in T1, depicting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°95 beginning from the back of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 692.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1470.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 852.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1700.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 197.5000 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, revealing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°95 initiated from the back of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 692.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1470.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 852.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1700.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 197.5000 mm³."
"MRI size (128, 256) in weighting T1, presenting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section. The observation is made on slice n°95 from the back of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 692.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1470.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 852.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1700.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 197.5000 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old, in slice coronal n°95 starting from the back of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 692.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1470.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 852.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1700.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 197.5000 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1, exposing the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°95 starting from the back of the skull. We see clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 692.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1470.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 852.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1700.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 197.5000 mm³."
