description
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1 showing the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°215 starting from the back of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 117.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 985.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 633.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 125.0000 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old, in slice coronal n°215 starting from the back of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 117.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 985.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 633.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 125.0000 mm³ in it."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°215 starting from the back of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 117.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 985.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 633.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 125.0000 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, of coronal section. We observe slice n°215 starting from the back of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 117.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 985.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 633.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 125.0000 mm³ in it."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, revealing the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°215 beginning from the back of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 117.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 985.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 633.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 125.0000 mm³ there."
