description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°60 starting from the base of the skull. We see clearly: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1103.7500 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 3.7500 mm³, the brainstem of volume 232.5000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1097.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 77.5000 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with axial section. We observe slice n°60 beginning from the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1103.7500 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 3.7500 mm³, the brainstem of volume 232.5000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1097.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 77.5000 mm³."
"Weighted MRI visualization size (128, 256) in T1 of the skull of a woman of 66 years old, with axial section n°60 starting at the base of the skull. The observed details include the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1103.7500 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 3.7500 mm³, the brainstem of volume 232.5000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1097.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 77.5000 mm³."
