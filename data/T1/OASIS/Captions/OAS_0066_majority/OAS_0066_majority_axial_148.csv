description
"Weighted MRI visualization size (128, 256) in T1 of the skull of a woman of 66 years old, with axial section n°148 starting at the base of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 67.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2186.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 67.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2185.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 207.5000 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with axial section. We observe slice n°148 beginning from the base of the skull. The section reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 67.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2186.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 67.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2185.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 207.5000 mm³."
