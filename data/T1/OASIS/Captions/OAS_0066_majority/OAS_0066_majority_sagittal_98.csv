description
"MRI image size (256, 256) in weighting T1 of a woman of 66 years old, with sagittal section n°98 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1712.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6766.2500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 97.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 561.2500 mm³."
"MRI image size (256, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with sagittal section. We observe slice n°98 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1712.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6766.2500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 97.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 561.2500 mm³."
