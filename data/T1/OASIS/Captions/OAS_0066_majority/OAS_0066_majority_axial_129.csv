description
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) visualization in T1 of the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°129 starting at the base of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1786.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3972.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1788.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4001.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 572.5000 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°129 starting from the base of the skull. The section reveals the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1786.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3972.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1788.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4001.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 572.5000 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°129 starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1786.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3972.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1788.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4001.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 572.5000 mm³."
"MRI size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old of axial section. The observation focuses on slice n°129 starting from the base of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1786.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3972.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1788.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4001.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 572.5000 mm³."
"Weighted MRI visualization size (128, 256) in T1 of the skull of a woman of 66 years old, with axial section n°129 starting at the base of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1786.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3972.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1788.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 4001.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 572.5000 mm³."
