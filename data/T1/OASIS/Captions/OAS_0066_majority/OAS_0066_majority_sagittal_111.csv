description
"Image size (256, 256) in weighting T1 of the MRI, showing the head of a woman of 66 years old of sagittal section. Slice n°111 is observed starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1887.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 163.7500 mm³."
