description
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1, exposing the skull of a person a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°142 beginning from the base of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 563.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2855.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 575.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3046.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 363.7500 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old with weighting in T1, of axial section. We observe slice n°142 beginning from the base of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 563.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2855.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 575.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3046.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 363.7500 mm³."
