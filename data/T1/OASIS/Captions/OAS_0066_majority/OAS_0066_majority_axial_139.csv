description
"MRI size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old of axial section. The observation focuses on slice n°139 starting from the base of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 887.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3216.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 865.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3357.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 358.7500 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old with weighting in T1, of axial section. We observe slice n°139 beginning from the base of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 887.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3216.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 865.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3357.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 358.7500 mm³."
"Illustration size (128, 256) by MRI of the head of a woman of 66 years old with weighting in T1, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°139 starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 887.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3216.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 865.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3357.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 358.7500 mm³."
"MRI representation size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, showing the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°139 initiated from the base of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 887.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3216.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 865.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3357.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 358.7500 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1, exposing the skull of a person a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°139 beginning from the base of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 887.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3216.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 865.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3357.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 358.7500 mm³."
