description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°71 starting from the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 556.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 45.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 992.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 88.7500 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) of a human head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with coronal section. We carefully examine slice n°71 from the back of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 556.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 45.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 992.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 88.7500 mm³."
