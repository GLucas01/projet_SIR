description
"MRI image size (128, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with axial section. We observe slice n°66 beginning from the base of the skull. The observed details include the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 672.5000 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 107.5000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1501.2500 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 12.5000 mm³, the brainstem of volume 401.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 671.2500 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 96.2500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1483.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 267.5000 mm³."
"Image size (128, 256) with weighting in T1 of the MRI, showing the head of a woman of 66 years old of axial section. Slice n°66 is observed starting from the base of the skull. The following elements are present : the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 672.5000 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 107.5000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1501.2500 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 12.5000 mm³, the brainstem of volume 401.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 671.2500 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 96.2500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1483.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 267.5000 mm³."
