description
"MRI size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old of axial section. The observation focuses on slice n°125 starting from the base of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2543.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3711.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2692.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3538.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 632.5000 mm³."

"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old with weighting in T1, of axial section n°125. We observe slice n°125 starting from the base of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2543.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3711.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2692.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3538.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 632.5000 mm³."
