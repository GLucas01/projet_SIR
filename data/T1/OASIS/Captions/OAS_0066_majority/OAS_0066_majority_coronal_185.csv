description
"Image in weighting T1 of the MRI size (128, 256), showing the head of a woman of 66 years old of coronal section. Slice n°185 is observed from the back of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 903.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2235.0000 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 265.0000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1286.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 683.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1888.7500 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 186.2500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1247.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 461.2500 mm³."
