description
"MRI image size (256, 256) in weighting T1 of a woman of 66 years old, with sagittal section n°90 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3495.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6905.0000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 926.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 505.0000 mm³ in it."
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) size (256, 256) capture representing the head of a woman aged  of 66 years old, with a sequence weighted in T1 and sagittal section, starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3495.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6905.0000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 926.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 505.0000 mm³."
