description
"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256) in T1, representing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°211 starting at the back of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 255.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1336.2500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 267.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 110.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 866.2500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 196.2500 mm³ there."
