description
"MRI image size (256, 256) weighted in T1, revealing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with sagittal section n°32 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2966.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5763.7500 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 1.2500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1266.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 503.7500 mm³."
