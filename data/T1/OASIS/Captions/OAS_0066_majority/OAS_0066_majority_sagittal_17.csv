description
"MRI image size (256, 256) of a human head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, of sagittal section. We observe slice n°17 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3078.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 96.2500 mm³."

"MRI image size (256, 256) in weighting T1, presenting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of sagittal section. The observation is made on slice n°17 from the right hemisphere of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3078.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 96.2500 mm³."
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) size (256, 256) capture representing the head of a woman aged  of 66 years old, with a sequence weighted in T1 and sagittal section, starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 6.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3078.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 96.2500 mm³."
