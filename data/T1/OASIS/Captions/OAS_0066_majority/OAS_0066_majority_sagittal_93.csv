description
"MRI image size (256, 256) of a human head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, of sagittal section. We observe slice n°93 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2730.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 7106.2500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 636.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 510.0000 mm³."
