description
"Weighted MRI image size (256, 256) in T1, depicting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of sagittal section n°27 beginning from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1406.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5568.7500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 890.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 428.7500 mm³."
