description
"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256) in T1, representing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°210 starting at the back of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 313.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1352.5000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 361.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 136.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 925.0000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 25.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 262.5000 mm³ there."
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256) with weighted imaging in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°210 beginning from the back of the skull. We distinguishe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 313.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1352.5000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 361.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 136.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 925.0000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 25.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 262.5000 mm³ in it."
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old, in slice coronal n°210 starting from the back of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 313.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1352.5000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 361.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 136.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 925.0000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 25.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 262.5000 mm³."
