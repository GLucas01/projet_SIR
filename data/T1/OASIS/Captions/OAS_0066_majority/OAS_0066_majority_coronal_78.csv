description
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1, exhibiting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°78 starting from the back of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 188.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 960.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 311.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1291.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 108.7500 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, of coronal section. We observe slice n°78 starting from the back of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 188.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 960.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 311.2500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1291.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 108.7500 mm³."
