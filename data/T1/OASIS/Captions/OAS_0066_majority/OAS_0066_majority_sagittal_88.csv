description
"MRI snapshot size (256, 256) in weighted T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old, of sagittal section n°88 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 4395.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 6251.2500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1086.2500 mm³, the left hippocampus of volume 8.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 622.5000 mm³."
"Image size (256, 256) in weighting T1 of the MRI, showing the head of a woman of 66 years old of sagittal section. Slice n°88 is observed starting from the right hemisphere of the skull.
