description
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°214 starting from the back of the skull. We observe the following characteristics: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 143.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1092.5000 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 6.2500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 8.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 706.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 157.5000 mm³."
