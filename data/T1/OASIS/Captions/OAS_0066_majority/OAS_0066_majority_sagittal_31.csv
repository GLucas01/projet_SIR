description
"MRI image size (256, 256) of a human head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with sagittal section. We observe slice n°31 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2550.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5780.0000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1186.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 575.0000 mm³."
"MRI size (256, 256) in weighting T1, showing the head of a woman of 66 years old, of sagittal section n°31 initiated from the right hemisphere of the skull. We see the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2550.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 5780.0000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1186.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 575.0000 mm³."
