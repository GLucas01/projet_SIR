description
"MRI image size (128, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with coronal section. We carefully observe slice n°193 beginning from the back of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 673.7500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2086.2500 mm³, the white matter of left hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 111.2500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 1260.0000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 633.7500 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1513.7500 mm³, the white matter of right hemisphere of cerebellum of volume 46.2500 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1086.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 330.0000 mm³ there."
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1, presenting the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal sectionn°193 beginning at the back of the skull.
