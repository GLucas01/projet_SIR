description
"MRI image size (128, 256) with weighted imaging in T1, depicting the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°119 beginning from the base of the skull. We see the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3282.5000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 3542.5000 mm³, the left lateral ventricle of volume 47.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3237.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 3506.2500 mm³, the right lateral ventricle of volume 48.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 613.7500 mm³."
