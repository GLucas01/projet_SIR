"MRI image size (256, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, with sagittal section. We observe slice n°16 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The following elements are present : the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 2618.7500 mm³ and the  of volume 110.0000 mm³."
