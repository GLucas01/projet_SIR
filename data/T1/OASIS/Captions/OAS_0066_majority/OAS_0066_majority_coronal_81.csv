description
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1, exhibiting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°81 starting from the back of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 251.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1097.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 442.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1340.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 140.0000 mm³."
"Weighted MRI image size (128, 256) in T1, representing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°81 starting at the back of the skull. The observed details include: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 251.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1097.5000 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 442.5000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1340.0000 mm³ and the  of volume 140.0000 mm³."
