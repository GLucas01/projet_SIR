description
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1, exhibiting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of coronal section n°91 starting from the back of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 546.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1393.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 770.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1596.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 197.5000 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, of coronal section. We observe slice n°91 beginning from the back of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 546.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1393.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 770.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1596.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 197.5000 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1, presenting the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal sectionn°91 beginning at the back of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 546.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1393.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 770.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1596.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 197.5000 mm³."
"MRI snapshot size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old, in slice coronal n°91 starting from the back of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 546.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1393.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 770.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1596.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 197.5000 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, revealing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with coronal section n°91 initiated from the back of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 546.2500 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 1393.7500 mm³, the white matter of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 770.0000 mm³, the cortex of right cerebral hemisphere of volume 1596.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 197.5000 mm³ there."
