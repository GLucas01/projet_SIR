description
"MRI image size (256, 256) of the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, of sagittal section. We observe slice n°95 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We observe the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2325.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 7068.7500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 416.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 508.7500 mm³ there."
"MRI image size (256, 256) illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old in weighting T1, of sagittal section. We observe slice n°95 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The image notably reveals the presence of: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2325.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 7068.7500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 416.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 508.7500 mm³."
"MRI size (256, 256) in weighting T1, showing the head of a woman of 66 years old, with sagittal section n°95 initiated from the right hemisphere of the skull. The following elements are present : the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2325.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 7068.7500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 416.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 508.7500 mm³."
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) size (256, 256) capture representing the head of a woman aged  of 66 years old, with a sequence weighted in T1 and sagittal section, starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. The observed details include the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2325.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 7068.7500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 416.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 508.7500 mm³."
"Weighted MRI size (256, 256) in T1, exhibiting the head of a woman of 66 years old, of sagittal section n°95 starting from the right hemisphere of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the white matter of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 2325.0000 mm³, the cortex of left cerebral hemisphere of volume 7068.7500 mm³, the left cerebellar cortex of volume 416.2500 mm³ and the  of volume 508.7500 mm³."
