description
"Weighted MRI size (128, 256) in T1, showing the skull of a person a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°59 starting from the base of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 991.2500 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 1.2500 mm³, the brainstem of volume 225.0000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1007.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 81.2500 mm³."
"Weighted magnetic resonance image size (128, 256) in T1, illustrating the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°59 starting from the base of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 991.2500 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 1.2500 mm³, the brainstem of volume 225.0000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1007.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 81.2500 mm³."
"MRI image size (128, 256) with weighted imaging in T1, depicting the skull of a woman of 66 years old, of axial section n°59 beginning from the base of the skull. We distinguishe clearly: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 991.2500 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 1.2500 mm³, the brainstem of volume 225.0000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1007.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 81.2500 mm³."
"MRI size (128, 256) with weighting in T1, illustrating the head of a woman of 66 years old of axial section. The observation focuses on slice n°59 starting from the base of the skull. The image reveals the presence of the left cerebellar cortex of volume 991.2500 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 1.2500 mm³, the brainstem of volume 225.0000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1007.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 81.2500 mm³."
"Illustration size (128, 256) by MRI of the head of a woman of 66 years old with weighting in T1, with axial section. We carefully examine slice n°59 starting from the base of the skull. The following elements are present in the image: the left cerebellar cortex of volume 991.2500 mm³, the fourth ventricle of volume 1.2500 mm³, the brainstem of volume 225.0000 mm³, the right cerebellar cortex of volume 1007.5000 mm³ and the  of volume 81.2500 mm³."
